	displayName = Sungrazer
	description = Sungrazing comets are very close to the sun at perihelion. Some may touch the edge of the solar atmosphere, while others may directly hit the sun. These outer Oort cloud objects enter the solar system when they are gravitational perturbations from stars near the sun. However, these are hard to find, so keep an eye out for them!
