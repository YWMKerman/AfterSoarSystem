        #ASS_Sun_name = The Sun
        #ASS_Sun_desc = This ancient star has reached the end of its life. The hydrogen in its core has been exhausted, and the hydrogen fusion in the core will stop. For 10 billion years, gravity and nuclear fusion have maintained the balance of this star. In the end, gravity defeated nuclear fusion. From this point on, nothing can stop the core from shrinking. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the sun's luminosity to increase, end the main sequence phase, and cause the sun to expand. Heating caused by gravitational contraction will also cause hydrogen fusion in the shell outside the core. It will eventually reach thousands of times the current brightness. The immense heat brought by fusion energy still causes the temperature of the inner solar system to rise to a point where carbon-based life cannot survive! All life in this once habitable galaxy has left this hellhole in search of new habitable environments, but the sun is prone to a helium flash at any time. Time is running out for this star system - hurry up.

		#ASS_Mercury_desc = This huge stone ball began to have many dense cracks at high temperatures, and these cracks were filled with hot lava. These cracks are gradually expanding. At the same time, affected by the strong tidal force of the red giant star, it begins to slowly approach the sun. At the same time, the sun is also expanding rapidly... At present, it is beginning to slow down under the influence of the sun's outer atmosphere. Before long, it will be completely swallowed by the sun.

        #ASS_Venus_name = Venus
		#ASS_Venus_desc = Venus (Latin: Venus), one of the eight planets in the solar system, has no satellites. In ancient China, it was called Taibai, Morning Star or Daxiao. In addition, it was called Qiming when it appeared in the east in the morning, and it was called Changgeng when it appeared in the west at sunset. Venus is a terrestrial planet. Because its size, mass, volume and distance from the sun are similar to those of the Earth, it is often called the Earth's sister planet. However, Venus was distinctly different from Earth in other ways. It has the thickest atmosphere among the four terrestrial planets, more than 96% of which is carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure on the surface of Venus is 92 times that of the Earth. The average temperature on its surface is as high as 735 K. Venus does not have a carbon cycle that absorbs carbon into its rocks, nor does it appear to have any organic life to absorb carbon from its biomass. It may have had oceans in the past and looked very similar to Earth, but all evaporated as temperatures rose due to the runaway greenhouse effect. Just like the earth today. Now, there are not many days left for this planet floating on the sea of fire. The intense high temperature causes the crust of Venus to begin to burn. At the same time, affected by the tidal force of the sun, Its orbit will gradually decrease, and it will eventually hit the outer layer of the sun. But before that happens, Venus may be blown to pieces by the sun's powerful helium flash.

        #ASS_Earth_name = Earth
        #ASS_Earth_desc = This planet was once the only celestial body known to have life in the human solar system, and it was also the planet where humans once lived. It is our home, the Earth. The average density of the Earth is 5.5 g/cm3, making it the highest planet among the planets in the solar system. On February 14, 1990, as the Voyager 1 spacecraft completed its first mission, astronomer Carl Sagan convinced NASA to have the control center issue a command instructing the spacecraft to look back to take pictures Planets in the solar system. NASA eventually compiled 60 frames of photos from this action into a family portrait of the solar system. One of the photos just captured the Earth in the mirror. In this photo taken from 6.4 billion kilometers away, the Earth is just a tiny "pale blue dot" in the grainy photo. The size of the Earth in the photo only accounts for 0.12 pixels of the entire photo. Since then, the probe has flown all the way towards the outer solar system without looking back, eventually becoming a wanderer of the Milky Way... \n Once the Earth provided the only environment capable of sustaining the evolution of life. It is believed that it was not long after the Earth was formed. Later, high-energy chemical reactions produced molecules that could replicate themselves. Another 500 million years later, the common ancestor of all life appeared, and then bacteria and archaea differentiated. Early life forms developed the ability to photosynthesize, harnessing solar energy directly and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. The oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere is affected by ultraviolet rays emitted by the sun, forming ozone in the upper atmosphere, and then the ozone layer appears. Early life existed in the form of prokaryotes. According to the symbiont theory, during the evolution of life, some small cells were engulfed into large cells and became endosymbiotic in the large cells, becoming organelles of the large cells, thus forming eukaryotic cells with a relatively complex structure. After that, the cells in each part of the cell community gradually differentiated into different functions, forming a true multicellular organism. As the ozone layer absorbs the harmful ultraviolet rays emitted by the sun, the land becomes habitable for life, and life begins to flourish on the land. \n This stability lasted for 1 billion years. Then, as the sun gradually aged, the earth's surface would eventually be affected by rising solar radiation, which would have serious consequences. Initially, it would only change from tropical areas to polar caps. Over time, the earth's surface temperature would rise. Speed up the inorganic carbon cycle and reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide content. The carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere will gradually drop to 10 ppm. At this time, no C4 plants can survive. The loss of vegetation will reduce the oxygen content of the earth's atmosphere, and the animals and plants on the earth will become extinct within millions of years. After that, surface water will evaporate into the atmosphere, which will lead to a serious greenhouse effect. As a result, the temperature of the earth will rise extremely, and the earth will become a second Venus. \n Now that the sun has entered the red giant stage, the sun will experience a helium flash at any time. The helium flash will completely strip off the planet's thick and dense atmosphere, and will also strip off the planet's surface layers hundreds or even thousands of meters deep. .. After the helium flash, the sun enters the asymptotic giant stage. This ancient planet with a long history and carrying human civilization into the universe may be able to survive the repeated expansion and contraction of the sun...

        #ASS_Moon_name = The Moon
        #ASS_Moon_desc = The moon is the earth's only natural satellite. It is the first celestial body visited by humans after leaving the earth. During the Apollo project, 12 humans once walked on its surface. \n The diameter of the moon is approximately equal to one-quarter of the Earth, and its mass is approximately 1/81 of the Earth. Relative to the planets it orbits, it is the largest satellite in terms of volume and mass, and is the fifth largest satellite in the solar system and the largest satellite in the solar system. The second densest satellite in the world, after Io. It is the largest satellite in the solar system in terms of its relative size to the planet (although Charon and the dwarf planet Pluto are relatively larger)\n The Moon is a synchronously rotating satellite of the Earth, rotating on its axis with the same period as the Earth's The orbital period is the same, which means it almost always faces the Earth with the same side. Likewise, the moon exerts tidal forces on the Earth, the most obvious of which are ocean tides and rising sea levels. Because the Earth spins about 27 times faster than the Moon orbits the Earth, this bulge is dragged across the Earth's surface faster than the Moon moves, making one complete rotation around the Earth's axis in about a day. Ocean tides are enhanced by a number of influences: friction as the water passes over the ocean floor coupled with the Earth's rotation, the inertia of the water as it moves, flat beaches close to land, and oscillations between different ocean basins. The sun's gravitational influence on Earth's ocean tides is about half that of the moon's, and their mutual gravitational influence creates spring and neap tides. \n The gravitational coupling between the Moon and the bulge on the side near the Moon creates a torque on the Earth's rotation, dissipating angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from the Earth's rotation. In turn, angular momentum is added to the Moon's orbit, accelerating the Moon, causing the Moon to rise into a higher orbit and have a longer orbital period. As a result, the distance between the Moon and the Earth increases, and the Earth's rotation slows. For billions of years, this ancient satellite has been moving away from the Earth at a rate of 3.8 centimeters per year. At the same time, it has also caused the Earth's rotation to slow down by about 15 microseconds per year. As the Moon continues to move away from the Earth, humans can no longer see it from the Earth. To total solar eclipse... \n Now, after the sun enters the red giant stage, the moon begins to gradually slow down its revolution speed under the influence of the sun. It begins to move in the opposite direction. This satellite will collide with the earth, but at this moment Never coming, the coming helium flash will most likely completely destroy this ancient object...

        #ASS_Mars_name = Mars
        #ASS_Mars_desc = When you look up at the stars on Earth, you will find the red dot. The fiery red color of this celestial body has attracted people since ancient times. The Greeks called it the "God of War". Ancient China: Named "Yinghuo" after its meaning of "ying like fire, whose brightness and position changes so much that it confuses people". "Shangshu Shun Dian" records: "On the Jade Scale, the Qizheng will be unified." Kong Yingda Shu said: "The Qizheng, there are seven of them. If you observe them on the Jade Scale, you must be in the sky. You will know that the Qizheng is the sun and the moon. There are five stars. Wood is called the Year Star, Fire is called the Yinghuo Star, Earth is called the Zhenxing, Venus is called the Taibai Star, and Water is called the Chenxing." It is said that the ancients observed that Yinghuo is red, and red belongs to fire in the "Five Elements", so they named it "Mars".\n When people entered the space era, they sent many detectors to visit this red celestial body, the most famous of which is the "Curiosity"... The data sent back to the earth by these detectors tell us that this red celestial body The celestial body also had water, rivers, and oceans just like the Earth in the past... In the past, the atmosphere of Mars was very thin. The Martian atmosphere was relatively thin, and the average surface pressure was only 6 hPa, about 0.6% of the Earth's surface pressure. Such a thin atmosphere caused many probes to lose contact and lose control after entering the Martian atmosphere, eventually leading to the failure of the mission. Mars also had a magnetic field in the past, but it disappeared later. The cooling of the earth's core caused the magnetic field to disappear. On Mars 11.6 billion years ago, the oceans evaporated and the atmosphere disappeared. In the end, only a small amount of water was preserved at the north and south poles of Mars. But even Mars, which is arid and cold, is known as the most Earth-like planet.\n The transformation plan of Mars began in 2100 AD. Human beings added appropriate amounts of gases (including greenhouse gases and gases suitable for biological survival) to the atmosphere to increase surface temperature and air pressure, mainly for liquid water, followed by plants and animals. . Secondly, a group of huge reflecting (or refracting) mirrors will be installed in space to increase the intensity of sunlight hitting the surface of Mars. Thaw a large amount of underground permafrost and bring water to the surface. Although it will freeze at first, as the project progresses, the ice will melt and form a hydrosphere. Cultivating dark algae or spreading dark substances such as soot on the ice (including the poles) increases heat absorption and accelerates melting. For this reason, humans built a large number of factories on Mars to discharge gases into the atmosphere of Mars. As the temperature increased, humans planted plants on Mars. After thousands of years, the atmosphere of Mars finally produced oxygen and liquid water oceans. . At the same time, it took tens of thousands of years to restore Mars' magnetic field.\nAs time goes by, Mars is no longer a red dot when viewed from the earth. This red dot is turning green little by little, and at the same time, the green is mixed with some blue. As the brightness of the sun increases day by day, the temperature of the earth has become higher and higher... The high temperature and humid environment have caused all humans on the earth to immigrate to this new celestial body to settle. When you come here, you will find that the environment here looks almost exactly like the Earth in the past. The only difference is that there is no moon here at night and it will be very dark. In this way, humans have lived on Mars for billions of years. At this moment, the sun has turned into a red giant and releases much more heat. Now, even on Mars, its temperature is close to the summer temperature in Africa. Such high temperatures require people to use refrigeration equipment indoors almost all the time and at night. In order to avoid the rapid heating of Mars as much as possible, humans built a huge reflecting prism at the Mars Lagrang L1 point to prevent as much light from reaching the surface of Mars as possible...\n But even so, there is not much time left for us. Soon, the ocean on Mars will boil, and finally change back to what it once was. At this time, all the remaining humans can do is escape from here and go to Titan, or Muna, can extend the time in the solar system as much as possible. But leaving the solar system is the best option.\nTake action, explorer.

        #ASS_Muna_name = Muna
		#ASS_Muna_desc = Muna/Jishen is an ancient super-Earth that was larger than the Earth in the solar system. But this super-Earth does not come from our solar system, but from a red dwarf star system. All this comes from 10.9 billion years ago...\n12.4 billion years ago, a small piece of dust in a corner of the Milky Way was being compressed. The dust was compressed inward in a spiral form, forming a dense celestial body that glowed and heated... and finally a star was born. This is a red dwarf star with spectrum M4V. In the subsequent time, the dust disk orbiting the star began to condense to form planets. At a location slightly farther from the star, three gaseous planets were being formed, with their orbits in a ratio of 1:2:4. Among them, the more inner objects formed rapidly. The two of them almost emptied all the material in the dust disk, forming huge gaseous planets. The celestial body outside the star system did not absorb enough material to form a gas planet, but evolved into a mini ice giant with a radius of about 8000km...\nAt this time, rocky objects in this star system were forming, and the two giant gaseous planets began to rapidly migrate outward, causing the fragile resonance orbit between them to break. The mini ice giant began to receive the gravitational pull of the outermost gaseous planet and was thrown into the star system. At this time, the parent star was young and powerful, and the strong solar wind blew away the atmosphere of the mini ice giant, which caused it to Became a super earth. When this super-Earth entered the star system, its huge gravity also disturbed the star system and captured a rocky planet that was forming. The rocky planet was close in size to Mercury... Since there is no planet in the star system Something can make this super Earth stop, so this super Earth moves in a highly eccentric orbit, causing its semi-major axis to jump in the gravitational slingshot of two gaseous planets... Finally, 12.2 billion years ago, The super-Earth was ejected into interstellar space, carrying a huge planetary fragment in the Milky Way for nearly 10 billion years...\n In 2.4 billion years, this super-Earth moved near the solar system. Due to its low relative speed, it entered the hyperbolic orbit of the sun. It crossed the Kuiper Belt and entered the solar system at a position close to the ecliptic. The huge gravity caused it to be hit by a large number of asteroids... Until now, you can see the traces left on Muna and its moon Moll. After passing through the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt, this super-Earth entered the inner solar system, passing Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn... Under the gravity of Jupiter, it entered the elliptical orbit of the sun from the hyperbolic orbit of the sun, and interacted with the sun. Jupiter formed a resonance orbit. Over the course of tens of thousands of years, it flew past Saturn and Jupiter many times, gradually lowering its aphelion and entering the asteroid belt at its perihelion. After a certain flyby of Jupiter, the super-Earth happened to enter the orbit of Hygiea. Due to the huge gravity and extremely high relative speed, Hygiea collided with this super Earth. This long impact caused Muna's speed to drop sharply, causing it to completely enter the asteroid belt and no longer intersect with any planets. The satellite captured by this super Earth maintained its original speed because its momentum did not change. However, it did not break away from the gravity of the super Earth, but entered a higher eccentricity orbit around it...

    	#ASS_Moll_name = Moll
		#ASS_Moll_desc = This is an ancient celestial body. Like Jishen, it does not belong to the solar system. \nThe object was formed inside a red dwarf star system about 10 billion years ago. Since it was formed inside a red dwarf star system, its core has a high iron content, thus forming a larger iron core. Therefore, the density is Achieved 4.81 grams per cubic centimeter. It has reached hydrostatic equilibrium. It should have been able to continue accreting debris in the dust disk of its parent star and continue to grow. However, due to the three gaseous planets outside the star system disrupting each other's orbits, the smaller ice giant was ejected. Entering the interior of the star system, the ice giant's strong gravitational pull captured the celestial body and kept it in its own orbit. Later, the thin atmosphere of the ice giant in a large elliptical orbit was blown away, and at a later date it was ejected by the gravity of two giant gaseous planets. At the same time as it was ejected, this huge piece of debris also left the original red dwarf star system along with the planet. and roamed the Milky Way for nearly ten billion years. Then it followed the planet into the orbit of the sun... Eventually, it was discovered by humans outside the solar system using the transit method, and was named "Moll", and the parent star was named "Muna/Jishen". Through the gravitational perturbation of Muna by Moll, it is found that the mass of Moll is 1/28.67 of Muna. Such a huge mass puts the system's center of mass at a distance of 6,929 kilometers from Muna's center of mass. For a celestial body with a radius of 7100km, it is almost on the surface. Even if it has such a large mass, according to human definition, it is still not a "double planet" but a satellite. Due to its strong tidal force, it and Muna are tidally locked with each other, with only one side always facing each other. But later, a scientific expedition team returned to the solar system and tried to accelerate Muna and the rotation of Muna's core to restore its magnetic field, but ultimately failed. This makes Muna's rotation period no longer as long as 10 days. At the same time, Moll also produced strong tidal forces and strong winds on Muna. Tidal forces can cause Muna's ocean to flood some low-lying areas.  This requires the colonial station to be at a high altitude, otherwise the sea water will flood。   \nOn the night of Jishen, you can see a huge gray disk hanging in the sky, but this disk is much larger than when you stood on the earth and looked at the moon 7.8 billion years ago. Although the reflectivity of Moll is very low, only 0.12. But due to its close proximity and large size, it is still very bright. Despite its size, it still cannot completely block the sun from forming a total solar eclipse. If you have the chance, you'll only see a partial eclipse.   \n Moll's structure is similar to that of Mercury, with a crust, mantle, and core. Moll's core is as massive as the Moon and has a radius of approximately 1,321 kilometers. This makes it the third densest object in the solar system .

At the same time, you can also find it quickly passing through the sky where you are. This is because the satellite's orbital period is very fast, and it only takes 10 hours to orbit Muna. Currently affected by strong tidal forces, its orbit is still migrating inward, eventually entering Muna's Roche limit and being torn into pieces. By then, we will be able to see that Muna has a beautiful halo.

        #ASS_Jupiter_desc = This ancient planet is the largest planet in the star system, with a mass 2.5 times that of all the planets in the star system combined. \n This is the planet in our solar system - Jupiter\n Jupiter is the fifth closest planet to the sun and the largest planet in the solar system. Astronomers discovered this planet very early. The Romans called it after their god. The planet is Jupiter. In ancient China, Jupiter was called the Sui Star. It took about 12 years to orbit the celestial sphere, which was the same as the earthly branches, and the Sui Star chronology was born. It is said that the ancients observed that the year star was cyan, and cyan belongs to wood in the "Five Elements", so they named it Jupiter. This planet is also the only way for humans to fly out of the solar system. Many detectors leaving the solar system have used the gravity of this planet to reach the speed of escaping from the sun, thus leaving the solar system. These include the New Horizons probe, Voyager 1, and 2 probes. \n In the past, Jupiter had a conspicuous feature, that is, the Great Red Spot - a persistent anticyclonic storm larger than the Earth, located 22° south of the equator, and its existence was known as early as 1665. This storm can be seen using a 12 cm or larger telescope. But the big red spot disappeared soon after. \nDue to its massive gravity well and proximity to the inner solar system, Jupiter is known as the solar system's vacuum cleaner. It is the planet most frequently hit by comets in the solar system. It is thought to be a protective umbrella that protects the planets in the inner solar system from comets. \n It has four larger satellites, called "Galileo" satellites. Among them, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto may have liquid oceans under their surfaces, so they are of great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Humanity has also sent multiple probes to these satellites, and the data sent back by the probes also confirms this. This is a precious fresh water resource. \n Today, the sun is about to die. Under the light of the early red giant star, the water that once existed in solid form begins to melt, forming rivers, rivers, lakes, and seas composed of liquid water. At the same time, an atmosphere is formed. These satellites are protected by Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The atmosphere can be protected from being stripped away by the solar wind... \n Maybe we can try to move our homes here?

		#ASS_Saturn_name = Saturn
		#ASS_Saturn_desc = Saturn is one of the eight planets in the solar system, and its size is second only to Jupiter. And it is a gas (Jupiter-like) giant planet like Jupiter. In ancient China, it was also called star-holding and star-filling. It is said that the ancients observed that the Zhenxing was yellow, and yellow belongs to the earth in the "Five Elements", so they named it Saturn.\nSaturn is famous for its beautiful rings. It was also the first planet to be discovered with rings. In July 1610, Galileo Galilei observed the rings of Saturn with his homemade telescope, but because of the poor imaging of the telescope, he did not realize that it was a ring. He wrote in a letter to the Grand Duke of Tuscany: "Saturn is not a single individual. It is composed of three parts. These parts are almost all in contact with each other and have no relative motion with each other. Their connection is parallel to the ecliptic, and the central part (Saturn's body) is about three times larger than the sides (rims of the rings)". He also described Saturn as having "ears." In 1612, the rings of Saturn were turned sideways toward the Earth and seemed to have disappeared. Galileo Galilei was confused and asked, "Did Saturn swallow up its children?" To prevent their descendants from rebelling and seizing power, they will eat their own children). Then, in 1613, he saw the ring again, which confused Galileo even more. In 1655, Christian Huygens observed the complete rings of Saturn, using a much more powerful telescope than was available in Galileo's time. Huygens observed Saturn and wrote: "It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat ring, which is not in contact with the planet and is tilted with respect to the ecliptic." In 1675, Giovanni Cassini determined the rings of Saturn It is composed of many smaller rings with gaps in the middle. The most obvious ring gap was soon named Cassini's gap. The Cassini gap exists between the A and B rings and is 4,800 kilometers wide.In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that Saturn's rings could not be solid, otherwise they would become unstable and break apart. He believed that the rings were composed of numerous small particles, each of which orbited Saturn independently. Through spectroscopic studies, James Keeler of Lick Observatory confirmed Maxwell's theory in 1895.\n One theory proposed in the 19th century originated from the Roche limit. It is believed that the ring was originally a satellite of Saturn. Due to the attenuation of the orbit, it fell into the range of the Roche limit. It was not tight enough and was torn apart by tidal forces. away (see Roche limit); this theory evolved into the theory that the satellite was disintegrated by the impact of an asteroid or comet, and the change that extended from this theory was that the satellite was disintegrated by the collision of a large comet or asteroid, thus Such a huge halo was formed. \n Under the influence of Saturn's magnetic field, material on the rings fell to Saturn in the form of a ring rain over hundreds of millions of years, and eventually the ring disappeared. Although Saturn still has a ring today, it is much dimmer than the ring that existed billions of years ago.\n Today, the sun has entered the red giant stage. Under the initial lighting conditions of the red giant, Saturn has initially entered the habitable zone. The higher temperature causes Saturn to gradually lose its original orange-green appearance and turn into white. At this moment, its moons will begin to come to life amid the death of the Sun

        #ASS_Uranus_name = Uranus			
		#ASS_Uranus_desc = This ancient planet has a unique rotation axis. Compared with other planets, its rotation axis is very strange. It looks like it is lying on the ecliptic plane while rotating around the sun. It is the Uranus of our solar system. Uranus had been observed many times before it was recognized as a planet, but people regarded it as a star. The earliest record can be traced back to 1690, when John Flamsteed listed it as "34 Tauri" in the star catalogue, and observed it at least 6 times. French astronomer Pierre Lemonnier also observed at least 12 times between 1750 and 1769, including one observation that lasted four consecutive nights. On March 13, 1781, the British William Herschel observed the planet in the courtyard of his home at 19 New King Street (now the Herschel Astronomical Museum) in Bath, Somerset County, England, but In his earliest report on April 26, 1781, he called it a "comet." Herschel "made a series of parallax observations of the star" using a telescope of his own design. Herschel notified the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, of his discovery, and received an incoherent reply from Maskelyne on 23 April: "I don't know what to call her. He is approaching." It moves in a circular orbit much like a planet, whereas a comet moves in a very flat elliptical orbit. I also saw no coma or tail." While Herschel continued to cautiously describe his new objects as comets, other astronomers had begun to cast different doubts. Russian astronomer Anders Johan Lexell estimated that he was 18 times farther from the Sun than the Earth, and no comet had ever been observed at perihelion beyond four times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. . Berlin astronomer Johann Bode described Herschel's discovery as if "stars moving in circular orbits beyond the orbit of Saturn may be regarded as hitherto unknown planet-like objects." Bode concluded that the circular object was more like a planet than a comet. This object was quickly accepted as a planet. In 1783, French scientist Laplace confirmed that what Herschel discovered was a planet. Herschel himself admitted this fact to Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Astronomical Society: "Observations by the most eminent astronomers of Europe revealed that this new star, which I had the honor of identifying in March 1781, It is one of the major planets in the solar system."  Uranus's rotation axis can be said to lie on the orbital plane, tilted at an angle of up to 97.77275°, which makes its seasonal changes completely different from other planets. The rotation axes of the other planets are all pointing upward relative to the orbital plane of the solar system. Uranus's rotation is like the tipping and rolling of a ball. When Uranus is near the solstice, one pole will continue to point toward the Sun and the other pole will point away from the Sun. Only in a narrow area near the equator can you experience the rapid alternation of day and night, but the position of the sun is very low, just like in the polar regions of the earth. When traveling to the other side of the orbit, the other pole of the axis points to the sun;           After the Sun entered the main sequence and became a red giant, the temperature of Uranus also rose to above 0 degrees Celsius. Thanks to its unusual tilt, the temperatures at Uranus' poles are sometimes even higher than the average temperature of Saturn! The methane (CH4) in Uranus's atmosphere will evaporate rapidly at such high temperatures. The absorption bands of this methane in the visible and near-infrared once gave Uranus its obvious blue-green or cyan color. But now they have disappeared. They were replaced by clouds made of water, which also caused Uranus' color to change from cyan in the past to gray-white today. This also results in its high reflectivity, which makes it easy to observe this object from PlanetNine. In addition, because the angle of Uranus's rotation axis is so large, this also causes the orbital inclination of its satellites to be as large as Uranus. This also causes the ice on the surface of the moons in this system to evaporate unusually quickly. Sometimes the surfaces of these moons are so hot that the rocks melt.

		#ASS_Pluto_desc = Pluto (134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans -Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has only one sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one third its volume. Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. , because the center of gravity of their orbits is not in any one celestial body, and they are tidally locked. The New Horizons mission, the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015, and made detailed measurements and observations. Discovered in 1930 AD, Pluto was the first object in the Kuiper Belt. It was immediately hailed as Planet Nine, but it was always a strange object whose planetary status was called into question when it was found to be much smaller than expected. These doubts grew as more objects in the Kuiper Belt began to be discovered in the 1990s, notably the more massive scattered disk Eris discovered in 2005. In 2006 AD, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially redefined the term "planet" to exclude dwarf planets such as dwarf planets. However, many planetary astronomers still consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets. Once Pluto was found, its faintness and lack of a viewable disc cast doubt on the idea that it was Lowell's Planet X. Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised downward throughout the 20th century. Its orbital characteristics are very different from those of planets, which orbit the sun in nearly circular orbits close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical) relative to the ecliptic. Although Pluto's orbit appears to intersect that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the orbits of the two objects do not intersect. Perturbations from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years, making collisions possible. However, Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: Pluto orbits the Sun twice, and Neptune orbits the Sun three times. This orbital resonance keeps Pluto stable over billions of years.        Once, Pluto was very cold, and more than 98% of the plain on the surface was composed of solid nitrogen and ice, and also contained trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. After the sun entered the red giant stage, its temperature began to heat up, and the solid nitrogen on the surface of Pluto began to melt and enter Pluto's atmosphere.      \n At the same time, methane, which once existed in solid form, has begun to melt and form lakes

		#ASS_Eris_desc = Eris (136199 Eris) is the second largest dwarf planet in the solar system, slightly smaller than Pluto, but more massive than Pluto. This is a highly eccentric discrete disk dwarf planet. Eris has a relatively large moon, Dysnomia. Because Eris appears larger than Pluto, NASA originally described it as the tenth planet in the solar system. This phenomenon, and the prospect of future discoveries of other similarly sized objects, prompted the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term "planet" for the first time. According to the definition approved by the International Astronomical Union on August 24, 2006, Eris, Pluto and Ceres are all "dwarf planets", reducing the number of known planets in the solar system to eight. The same amount as before the discovery of Pluto in 1930 AD. Observations of the stellar occultation Eris in 2010 showed that it is slightly smaller than Pluto, with an average diameter of 2,377±4 kilometers (1,477±2 miles) measured by New Horizons in July 2015. As the brightness of the sun continues to increase, this big snowball far away from the edge of the Kuiper Belt begins to melt... Nitrogen existing in solid form begins to sublimate, forming a thin atmosphere.

		#ASS_PlanetNine_desc = ( Planet Nine / Hades / Telisto / Proserpine / Kore / Allecto / Megaera / Tisiphone )   Under the turbulent cirrus clouds is a gaseous planet core that has been ravaged by winds several times the speed of sound for nearly 10 billion years. \n This is the ninth planet in our solar system. It is the planet that took the longest time for us humans to discover. It took 182 years to discover it after the last discovery of Neptune. For tens of billions of years, it has been lurking in the Oort cloud in the solar system. Because it is too far away from the sun, it moves very slowly in the sky, and when viewed from the earth, it almost always lies in front of a star cluster. Therefore, human telescopes mistook it for a star. The planet was first suggested as a possibility in 1846. Following the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The best-known of these theories predicted the existence of a distant planet that was influencing the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. After extensive calculations Percival Lowell predicted the possible orbit and location of the hypothetical trans-Neptunian planet and began an extensive search for it in 1906. He called the hypothetical object Planet X, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. Clyde Tombaugh continued Lowell's search and in 1930 discovered Pluto, but it was soon determined to be too small to qualify as Lowell's Planet Nine. After Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune in 1989, the difference between Uranus' predicted and observed orbit was determined to have been due to the use of a previously inaccurate mass of Neptune. Attempts to detect planets beyond Neptune by indirect means such as orbital perturbation date back to before the discovery of Pluto. Among the first was George Forbes who postulated the existence of two trans-Neptunian planets in 1880. One would have an average distance from the Sun , or semi-major axis, of 100 astronomical units (AU), 100 times that of the Earth. The second would have a semi-major axis of 300 AU. His work is considered similar to more recent Planet Nine theories in that the planets would be responsible for a clustering of the orbits of several objects, in this case the clustering of aphelion distances of periodic comets near 100 and 300 AU. This is similar to how the aphelion distances of Jupiter-family comets cluster near its orbit.The discovery of Sedna's peculiar orbit in 2004 led to speculation that it had encountered a massive body other than one of the known planets. Sedna's orbit is detached, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU that is too large to be due to gravitational interactions with Neptune . Several authors proposed that Sedna entered this orbit after encountering a massive body such as an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a member of the open cluster that formed with the Sun, or another star that later passed near the Solar System.The announcement in March 2014 of the discovery of a second sednoid with a perihelion distance of 80 AU, 2012 VP113, in a similar orbit led to renewed speculation that an unknown super-Earth remained in the distant Solar System. At a conference in 2012, Rodney Gomes proposed that an undetected planet was responsible for the orbits of some ETNOs with detached orbits and the large semi-major axis Centaurs, small Solar System bodies that cross the orbits of the giant planets.The proposed Neptune- massed planet would be in a distant (1500 AU), eccentric (eccentricity 0.4), and inclined (inclination 40°) orbit. Like Planet Nine it would cause the perihelia of objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU to oscillate, delivering some into planet-crossing orbits and others into detached orbits like that of Sedna. An article by Gomes, Soares, and Brasser was published in 2015, detailing their arguments. In 2014, astronomers Chad Trujillo and Scott S. Sheppard noted the similarities in the orbits of Sedna and 2012 VP113 and several other ETNOs. They proposed that an unknown planet in a circular orbit between 200 and 300 AU was perturbing their orbits. Later that year , Raúl and Carlos de la Fuente Marcos argued that two massive planets in orbital resonance were necessary to produce the similarities of so many orbits, 13 known at the time. Using a larger sample of 39 ETNOs, they estimated that the nearer planet had a semi -major axis in the range of 300–400 AU, a relatively low eccentricity, and an inclination of nearly 14 degrees. Later, people compared previous images and discovered that the "point" in the sky had moved decades ago, and finally discovered that it was a celestial body orbiting the sun. This confirmed that it was the ninth planet we were looking for. Later, people compared previous images and discovered that the "point" in the sky had moved decades ago, and finally discovered that it was a celestial body orbiting the sun. This confirmed that it was the ninth planet we were looking for.  In the past, it has been lurking in the dark areas at the edge of the solar system for a long time. We initially only speculated on the possibility of its existence from those trans-Neptunian objects with abnormal orbits. In the past, we were unable to observe this planet with any telescope because it was so far away that even the most powerful telescopes would not be able to detect it because it would be obscured by the light of background stars.    Even the probe can't get there before it runs out of power, so we still know very little about this planet. Now, after the sun enters the red giant stage, the brightness of the sun is thousands of times greater than before. The brightness of the planet is now close to that of Pluto in the past...     We can already see it using the Survey Telescope at PlanetNine's Lagrange L2 point. Although we had already arrived in a spacecraft before and viewed the planet up close.   This is a blue planet. The blue color of this planet is different from that of Jupiter today. Its blue color is due to the presence of trace amounts of methane in the atmosphere at high altitudes in Planet Nine's atmosphere. The main absorption bands appear in the red and infrared spectral positions of wavelengths above 600 nanometers. This gives Planet Nine a bluish hue, similar to that of Neptune 8 billion years ago. At the same time, it has a huge star ring. The material in this ring is mainly composed of ice. However, due to the distance, the brightness of the sun is too low, and even materials with high reflectivity appear very dim.                    The mass of the sun is slowly losing. Soon, the sun's gravity will no longer be able to bind this planet far away in the Oort cloud. By then, it will become an interstellar planet.
