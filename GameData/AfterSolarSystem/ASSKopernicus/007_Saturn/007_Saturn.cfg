			description = #ASS_Saturn_desc//Saturn is one of the eight planets in the solar system, and its size is second only to Jupiter. And it is a gas (Jupiter-like) giant planet like Jupiter. In ancient China, it was also called star-holding and star-filling. It is said that the ancients observed that the Zhenxing was yellow, and yellow belongs to the earth in the "Five Elements", so they named it Saturn.\nSaturn is famous for its beautiful rings. It was also the first planet to be discovered with rings. In July 1610, Galileo Galilei observed the rings of Saturn with his homemade telescope, but because of the poor imaging of the telescope, he did not realize that it was a ring. He wrote in a letter to the Grand Duke of Tuscany: "Saturn is not a single individual. It is composed of three parts. These parts are almost all in contact with each other and have no relative motion with each other. Their connection is parallel to the ecliptic, and the central part (Saturn's body) is about three times larger than the sides (rims of the rings)". He also described Saturn as having "ears." In 1612, the rings of Saturn were turned sideways toward the Earth and seemed to have disappeared. Galileo Galilei was confused and asked, "Did Saturn swallow up its children?" To prevent their descendants from rebelling and seizing power, they will eat their own children). Then, in 1613, he saw the ring again, which confused Galileo even more. In 1655, Christian Huygens observed the complete rings of Saturn, using a much more powerful telescope than was available in Galileo's time. Huygens observed Saturn and wrote: "It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat ring, which is not in contact with the planet and is tilted with respect to the ecliptic." In 1675, Giovanni Cassini determined the rings of Saturn It is composed of many smaller rings with gaps in the middle. The most obvious ring gap was soon named Cassini's gap. The Cassini gap exists between the A and B rings and is 4,800 kilometers wide.In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that Saturn's rings could not be solid, otherwise they would become unstable and break apart. He believed that the rings were composed of numerous small particles, each of which orbited Saturn independently. Through spectroscopic studies, James Keeler of Lick Observatory confirmed Maxwell's theory in 1895.\n One theory proposed in the 19th century originated from the Roche limit. It is believed that the ring was originally a satellite of Saturn. Due to the attenuation of the orbit, it fell into the range of the Roche limit. It was not tight enough and was torn apart by tidal forces. away (see Roche limit); this theory evolved into the theory that the satellite was disintegrated by the impact of an asteroid or comet, and the change that extended from this theory was that the satellite was disintegrated by the collision of a large comet or asteroid, thus Such a huge halo was formed. \n Under the influence of Saturn's magnetic field, material on the rings fell to Saturn in the form of a ring rain over hundreds of millions of years, and eventually the ring disappeared. Although Saturn still has a ring today, it is much dimmer than the ring that existed billions of years ago.\n Today, the sun has entered the red giant stage. Under the initial lighting conditions of the red giant, Saturn has initially entered the habitable zone. The higher temperature causes Saturn to gradually lose its original orange-green appearance and turn into white. At this moment, its moons will begin to come to life amid the death of the Sun
