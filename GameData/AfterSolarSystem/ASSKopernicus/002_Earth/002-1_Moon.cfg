			displayName = #ASS_Moon_name//The Moon
			description = #ASS_Moon_desc//The moon is the earth's only natural satellite. It is the first celestial body visited by humans after leaving the earth. During the Apollo project, 12 humans once walked on its surface. \n The diameter of the moon is approximately equal to one-quarter of the Earth, and its mass is approximately 1/81 of the Earth. Relative to the planets it orbits, it is the largest satellite in terms of volume and mass, and is the fifth largest satellite in the solar system and the largest satellite in the solar system. The second densest satellite in the world, after Io. It is the largest satellite in the solar system in terms of its relative size to the planet (although Charon and the dwarf planet Pluto are relatively larger)\n The Moon is a synchronously rotating satellite of the Earth, rotating on its axis with the same period as the Earth's The orbital period is the same, which means it almost always faces the Earth with the same side. Likewise, the moon exerts tidal forces on the Earth, the most obvious of which are ocean tides and rising sea levels. Because the Earth spins about 27 times faster than the Moon orbits the Earth, this bulge is dragged across the Earth's surface faster than the Moon moves, making one complete rotation around the Earth's axis in about a day. Ocean tides are enhanced by a number of influences: friction as the water passes over the ocean floor coupled with the Earth's rotation, the inertia of the water as it moves, flat beaches close to land, and oscillations between different ocean basins. The sun's gravitational influence on Earth's ocean tides is about half that of the moon's, and their mutual gravitational influence creates spring and neap tides. \n The gravitational coupling between the Moon and the bulge on the side near the Moon creates a torque on the Earth's rotation, dissipating angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from the Earth's rotation. In turn, angular momentum is added to the Moon's orbit, accelerating the Moon, causing the Moon to rise into a higher orbit and have a longer orbital period. As a result, the distance between the Moon and the Earth increases, and the Earth's rotation slows. For billions of years, this ancient satellite has been moving away from the Earth at a rate of 3.8 centimeters per year. At the same time, it has also caused the Earth's rotation to slow down by about 15 microseconds per year. As the Moon continues to move away from the Earth, humans can no longer see it from the Earth. To total solar eclipse... \n Now, after the sun enters the red giant stage, the moon begins to gradually slow down its revolution speed under the influence of the sun. It begins to move in the opposite direction. This satellite will collide with the earth, but at this moment Never coming, the coming helium flash will most likely completely destroy this ancient object...
