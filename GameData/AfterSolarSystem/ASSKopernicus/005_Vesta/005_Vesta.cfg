			description = #ASS_Vesta_desc//Vesta, the asteroid number is 4 Vesta. Vesta is the most massive main belt asteroid after the dwarf planet Ceres. It accounts for 9% of the total mass of the main asteroid belt. Although it has more mass than Pallas, its volume is smaller Small, it is the second largest asteroid. Vesta formed the remaining protoplanet of the rocky planets (internal differentiation).\n Pallas was discovered by Heinrich Obers in 1802, a year after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter to the British astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that more debris might be found near the intersection of the orbits of Ceres and Pallas. The intersection of these orbits is in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo. Obers began his search in 1802, and on March 29, 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation of Virgo - a coincidence because Ceres, Pallas and Vesta It is not a fragment of a larger celestial body. Because the third asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804 in what is now known as the main asteroid belt, Vesta became the fourth asteroid discovered. The discovery was announced in a letter to German astronomer Johann Schröter on March 31. Because Obers had already had the honor of discovering a planet (the asteroid Pallas was considered a planet at the time), He gave the honor of naming the newly discovered asteroid to the German mathematician Gauss, whose orbit calculations helped astronomers confirm the existence of the first asteroid Ceres, which could be calculated in just 10 hours of observation The glory of a newly discovered asteroid orbit. Gauss decided to name the asteroid after the chaste Vesta, the patron saint of hearths and families in Roman mythology, which is translated as Vesta in Chinese. After Vesta was discovered in 1807, no other asteroid was discovered for 37 years. During this period, only four asteroids were known, so they had their own symbols, with Vesta's symbol having a hearthside style.
