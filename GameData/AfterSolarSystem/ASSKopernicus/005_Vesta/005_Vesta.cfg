			description = #ASS_Vesta_desc//Vesta(4 Vesta)  NASA's Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around Vesta from July 16, 2011 to September 5, 2012, conducted exploration for nearly a year, and then headed to Ceres. Pallas was discovered by Heinrich Obers in 1802, a year after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter to the British astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that more debris might be found near the intersection of the orbits of Ceres and Pallas. The intersection of these orbits is in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo.           Vesta is the second most massive asteroid in the main asteroid belt, but its mass is only 28% of Ceres. It is less dense than the four inner planets, but higher than most moons and other asteroids. Its surface area is approximately as large as Pakistan (approximately 800,000 square kilometers). Vesta's orbit lies inside the Kirkwood Gap of the asteroid belt, within 2.50 AU. It has a differentiated interior and is slightly smaller (within a margin of error) than Pallas, but about 25% more massive. The shape of Vesta is close to a gravity-relaxed ellipsoid, but there are huge depressions and protrusions at the south pole, coupled with a mass of less than 5 × 1020 kg, making it automatically excluded by Resolution 5 of the 26th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union. Recognized as a dwarf planet. Recent shape analysis of Vesta  and gravity field data collected using the Dawn spacecraft indicate that Vesta has not yet reached hydrostatic equilibrium. As far as asteroids are concerned, its rotation is relatively fast (period 5.342 hours) and is prograde. The north pole points to right ascension 20h32min, declination +48° (in Cygnus), and there is an uncertainty of about 10° . The tilt angle of the rotation axis is 29°.  The surface temperature is estimated to be -20°C in the middle of the day; in winter, the temperature at the extremes is as low as -190°C. Normal day and night temperatures are -60°C and -130°C respectively. The above estimates were made on May 6, 1996, when Vesta was very close to perihelion. Details may vary slightly with the seasons. In the past, Vesta's maximum temperature could rise to -3 degrees Celsius. But now, as the sun's brightness continues to increase, its temperature has gradually risen to the point where rocks melt.
