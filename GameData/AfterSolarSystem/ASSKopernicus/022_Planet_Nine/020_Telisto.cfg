			description = #ASS_PlanetNine_desc//( Planet Nine / Telisto / Proserpine / Kore / Allecto / Megaera / Tisiphone )   This is the ninth planet in our solar system. It is the planet that took the longest time for us humans to discover. It took 182 years to discover it after the last discovery of Neptune. For tens of billions of years, it has been lurking in the Kuiper Belt in the solar system. Because it is too far away from the sun, it moves very slowly in the sky, and when viewed from the earth, it almost always lies in front of a star cluster. Therefore, human telescopes mistook it for a star. The planet was first suggested as a possibility in 1846. Following the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The best-known of these theories predicted the existence of a distant planet that was influencing the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. After extensive calculations Percival Lowell predicted the possible orbit and location of the hypothetical trans-Neptunian planet and began an extensive search for it in 1906. He called the hypothetical object Planet X, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. Clyde Tombaugh continued Lowell's search and in 1930 discovered Pluto, but it was soon determined to be too small to qualify as Lowell's Planet Nine. After Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune in 1989, the difference between Uranus' predicted and observed orbit was determined to have been due to the use of a previously inaccurate mass of Neptune. Attempts to detect planets beyond Neptune by indirect means such as orbital perturbation date back to before the discovery of Pluto. Among the first was George Forbes who postulated the existence of two trans-Neptunian planets in 1880. One would have an average distance from the Sun , or semi-major axis, of 100 astronomical units (AU), 100 times that of the Earth. The second would have a semi-major axis of 300 AU. His work is considered similar to more recent Planet Nine theories in that the planets would be responsible for a clustering of the orbits of several objects, in this case the clustering of aphelion distances of periodic comets near 100 and 300 AU. This is similar to how the aphelion distances of Jupiter-family comets cluster near its orbit.The discovery of Sedna's peculiar orbit in 2004 led to speculation that it had encountered a massive body other than one of the known planets. Sedna's orbit is detached, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU that is too large to be due to gravitational interactions with Neptune . Several authors proposed that Sedna entered this orbit after encountering a massive body such as an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a member of the open cluster that formed with the Sun, or another star that later passed near the Solar System.The announcement in March 2014 of the discovery of a second sednoid with a perihelion distance of 80 AU, 2012 VP113, in a similar orbit led to renewed speculation that an unknown super-Earth remained in the distant Solar System. At a conference in 2012, Rodney Gomes proposed that an undetected planet was responsible for the orbits of some ETNOs with detached orbits and the large semi-major axis Centaurs, small Solar System bodies that cross the orbits of the giant planets.The proposed Neptune- massed planet would be in a distant (1500 AU), eccentric (eccentricity 0.4), and inclined (inclination 40°) orbit. Like Planet Nine it would cause the perihelia of objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU to oscillate, delivering some into planet-crossing orbits and others into detached orbits like that of Sedna. An article by Gomes, Soares, and Brasser was published in 2015, detailing their arguments. In 2014, astronomers Chad Trujillo and Scott S. Sheppard noted the similarities in the orbits of Sedna and 2012 VP113 and several other ETNOs. They proposed that an unknown planet in a circular orbit between 200 and 300 AU was perturbing their orbits. Later that year , Raúl and Carlos de la Fuente Marcos argued that two massive planets in orbital resonance were necessary to produce the similarities of so many orbits, 13 known at the time. Using a larger sample of 39 ETNOs, they estimated that the nearer planet had a semi -major axis in the range of 300–400 AU, a relatively low eccentricity, and an inclination of nearly 14 degrees. Later, people compared previous images and discovered that the "point" in the sky had moved decades ago, and finally discovered that it was a celestial body orbiting the sun. This confirmed that it was the ninth planet we were looking for. Later, people compared previous images and discovered that the "point" in the sky had moved decades ago, and finally discovered that it was a celestial body orbiting the sun. This confirmed that it was the ninth planet we were looking for.  In the past, it has been lurking in the dark areas at the edge of the solar system for a long time. We initially only speculated on the possibility of its existence from those trans-Neptunian objects with abnormal orbits. In the past, we were unable to observe this planet with any telescope because it was so far away that even the most powerful telescopes would not be able to detect it because it would be obscured by the light of background stars.    Even the probe can't get there before it runs out of power, so we still know very little about this planet. Now, after the sun enters the red giant stage, the brightness of the sun is thousands of times greater than before. The brightness of the planet is now close to that of Pluto in the past...     We can already see it using the Survey Telescope at Muna's Lagrange L2 point. Although we had already arrived in a spacecraft before and viewed the planet up close.   This is a blue planet. The blue color of this planet is different from that of Jupiter today. Its blue color is due to the presence of trace amounts of methane in the atmosphere at high altitudes in Planet Nine's atmosphere. The main absorption bands appear in the red and infrared spectral positions of wavelengths above 600 nanometers. This gives Planet Nine a bluish hue, similar to that of Neptune 8 billion years ago. At the same time, it has a huge star ring. The material in this ring is mainly composed of ice. However, due to the distance, the brightness of the sun is too low, and even materials with high reflectivity appear very dim.                    The mass of the sun is slowly losing. Soon, the sun's gravity will no longer be able to bind this planet far away in the Oort cloud. By then, it will become an interstellar planet.
