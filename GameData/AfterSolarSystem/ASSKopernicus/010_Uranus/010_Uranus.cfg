			description = #ASS_Uranus_desc//This ancient planet has a unique rotation axis. Compared with other planets, its rotation axis is very strange. It looks like it is lying on the ecliptic plane while rotating around the sun. It is the Uranus of our solar system. Uranus had been observed many times before it was recognized as a planet, but people regarded it as a star. The earliest record can be traced back to 1690, when John Flamsteed listed it as "34 Tauri" in the star catalogue, and observed it at least 6 times. French astronomer Pierre Lemonnier also observed at least 12 times between 1750 and 1769, including one observation that lasted four consecutive nights. On March 13, 1781, the British William Herschel observed the planet in the courtyard of his home at 19 New King Street (now the Herschel Astronomical Museum) in Bath, Somerset County, England, but In his earliest report on April 26, 1781, he called it a "comet." Herschel "made a series of parallax observations of the star" using a telescope of his own design. Herschel notified the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, of his discovery, and received an incoherent reply from Maskelyne on 23 April: "I don't know what to call her. He is approaching." It moves in a circular orbit much like a planet, whereas a comet moves in a very flat elliptical orbit. I also saw no coma or tail." While Herschel continued to cautiously describe his new objects as comets, other astronomers had begun to cast different doubts. Russian astronomer Anders Johan Lexell estimated that he was 18 times farther from the Sun than the Earth, and no comet had ever been observed at perihelion beyond four times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. . Berlin astronomer Johann Bode described Herschel's discovery as if "stars moving in circular orbits beyond the orbit of Saturn may be regarded as hitherto unknown planet-like objects." Bode concluded that the circular object was more like a planet than a comet. This object was quickly accepted as a planet. In 1783, French scientist Laplace confirmed that what Herschel discovered was a planet. Herschel himself admitted this fact to Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Astronomical Society: "Observations by the most eminent astronomers of Europe revealed that this new star, which I had the honor of identifying in March 1781, It is one of the major planets in the solar system."  Uranus's rotation axis can be said to lie on the orbital plane, tilted at an angle of up to 97.77275Â°, which makes its seasonal changes completely different from other planets. The rotation axes of the other planets are all pointing upward relative to the orbital plane of the solar system. Uranus's rotation is like the tipping and rolling of a ball. When Uranus is near the solstice, one pole will continue to point toward the Sun and the other pole will point away from the Sun. Only in a narrow area near the equator can you experience the rapid alternation of day and night, but the position of the sun is very low, just like in the polar regions of the earth. When traveling to the other side of the orbit, the other pole of the axis points to the sun;           After the Sun entered the main sequence and became a red giant, the temperature of Uranus also rose to above 0 degrees Celsius. Thanks to its unusual tilt, the temperatures at Uranus' poles are sometimes even higher than the average temperature of Saturn! The methane (CH4) in Uranus's atmosphere will evaporate rapidly at such high temperatures. The absorption bands of this methane in the visible and near-infrared once gave Uranus its obvious blue-green or cyan color. But now they have disappeared. They were replaced by clouds made of water, which also caused Uranus' color to change from cyan in the past to gray-white today. This also results in its high reflectivity, which makes it easy to observe this object from Muna. In addition, because the angle of Uranus's rotation axis is so large, this also causes the orbital inclination of its satellites to be as large as Uranus. This also causes the ice on the surface of the moons in this system to evaporate unusually quickly. Sometimes the surfaces of these moons are so hot that the rocks melt.
