			description = #ASS_Venus_desc//Venus (Latin: Venus), one of the eight planets in the solar system, has no satellites. In ancient China, it was called Taibai, Morning Star or Daxiao. In addition, it was called Qiming when it appeared in the east in the morning, and it was called Changgeng when it appeared in the west at sunset. Venus is a terrestrial planet. Because its size, mass, volume and distance from the sun are similar to those of the Earth, it is often called the Earth's sister planet. However, Venus was distinctly different from Earth in other ways. It has the thickest atmosphere among the four terrestrial planets, more than 96% of which is carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure on the surface of Venus is 92 times that of the Earth. The average temperature on its surface is as high as 735 K. Venus does not have a carbon cycle that absorbs carbon into its rocks, nor does it appear to have any organic life to absorb carbon from its biomass. It may have had oceans in the past and looked very similar to Earth, but all evaporated as temperatures rose due to the runaway greenhouse effect. Just like the earth today. Now, there are not many days left for this planet floating on the sea of fire. The intense high temperature causes the crust of Venus to begin to burn. At the same time, affected by the tidal force of the sun, Venus is gradually locked by the sun's tide. At the same time, it is affected by the outer layer of the sun. Its orbit will gradually decrease, and it will eventually hit the outer layer of the sun. But before that happens, Venus may be blown to pieces by the sun's powerful helium flash.
