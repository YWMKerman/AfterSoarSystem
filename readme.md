# _****Introduction****_

  After Solar System (ASS) is the sequel to Real Solar System. It roughly simulates what our solar system might look like in a billions years.
  at that moment, the sun has just entered the red giant phase, with a spectrum of K7III, The earth is already uninhabitable. The high temperature and thick atmosphere make the earth Become a purgatory. At this time, there are still a small number of humans lingering on Mars, but the temperature of Mars has risen to an average of 40 degrees Celsius, and there is not much time left for them.
At the same time, the ice and snow on the surface of the three Galilean satellites Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto have melted, forming liquid water oceans and thin atmospheres, but they will not last long. And Saturn’s satellite Titan, which is farther away, has gradually become habitable due to human environmental modification, and the seeds of life are about to bloom on Titan... 

But it won't take long, the sun will begin to expand rapidly, and the habitable zone will be far beyond the orbit of Saturn. Therefore we must leave the solar system and find a new home, This is the optimal solution.  "The solar system is the cradle of mankind, but you can't stay in the cradle forever."

_***Come on, let's take action.***_

# _Roughly relevant knowledge:_

### ***_Understand the evolution of The Sun_***
_Our sun is a G2V main sequence star. As a main sequence star, its mass occupies 99.86 of the solar system. The Sun is estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs. As a G2V main sequence star, our sun has a lifespan of approximately 10 billion years. The sun is currently 4.6 billion years old. In about 5-6 billion years, when our sun will have exhausted the hydrogen in its core, hydrogen fusion in the core will cease and there will be nothing to stop the core from shrinking. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the sun's luminosity to increase, end the main sequence stage, and cause the sun to gradually expand, first becoming a subgiant and then a red giant. At the same time, heating caused by gravitational contraction will also cause hydrogen fusion in the shell outside the core. The unfused hydrogen remains there, helping to increase the luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1,000 times the current brightness! The expansion of the volume will cause Mercury to move in the sun's atmosphere. Eventually, the high temperature will destroy Mercury, and Mercury will be engulfed by the sun._

_As our sun expands, the orbits of other planets will gradually shift outward due to the mass loss of the sun itself. After the red giant branch, the Sun has about 120 million years of active life left, but a lot has happened: "During the stage of red giant evolution, the nuclear fusion of hydrogen ceases in the core as the hydrogen is depleted, leaving Helium-rich core. However, the fusion of hydrogen continues in the shell outside the core, and the produced helium will continue to accumulate into the core, making the core denser. But unlike massive stars, the temperature can never reach helium level of fusion, so the helium fusion reaction does not begin. This causes the thermal pressure generated by nuclear fusion to no longer be sufficient to resist gravitational collapse, creating the hydrostatic equilibrium found in most stars. This causes the star to begin to shrink and The temperature is increased until it is finally compressed enough for the helium core to become degenerate. This degeneracy pressure is finally enough to prevent further collapse of the centermost material, but the rest of the core continues to shrink and the temperature continues to rise. Until the point where the helium fusion reaction can be ignited and helium fusion begins. Explosive helium flash originates from degenerate matter. Once the temperature reaches 100 million to 200 million K, helium fusion will begin to proceed in the 3-helium process, and the temperature will increase rapidly. Rise, further increasing the helium fusion rate, and because degenerate matter is a good heat conductor, the reaction area will expand._   _However, since degenerate pressure (which is purely a function of density) dominates over thermal pressure (which is proportional to the product of density and temperature), the dependence of the total pressure on temperature is rather weak. Therefore, a sudden increase in temperature results in only a slight increase in pressure, so the core does not cool down with steady expansion.
The rate of this runaway reaction can climb to about 100 billion times normal energy production in a matter of seconds, but degenerate matter is not eliminated until the temperature rises to the point where thermal pressure once again dominates. The core can then expand and cool, and helium burning will stabilize and continue. ” So our sun will have a helium flash.   After the helium flash, the Sun shrank to about 10 times its current size, 50 times its luminosity, and was a little cooler than it is now. It will then reach the Red clump, or horizontal branch, but stars with solar metallicity will not evolve toward blue along the horizontal branch. On the contrary, as it continues to react with helium in the core. When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core is exhausted. This time, however, it all happened faster, the sun became bigger and brighter, and if Venus had survived the sun's red giant phase before, it might be doomed now. This is the Asymptotic Giant Branch Star stage (abbreviated as AGB stage). After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun became increasingly unstable, rapidly losing mass and increasing in size and luminosity every 100,000 years or so for hundreds of years due to thermal pulses. The thermal pulses grew larger each time, with subsequent pulses pushing the luminosity to 5,000 times its current level and a radius of more than 1 AU! The Sun would then become the brightest star in the night sky. For our Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer shell and begins to form a planetary nebula. By the end of this phase, which lasts about 500,000 years, the Sun will eventually have only about half its current mass. The later evolution of the asymptotic megabranch is even faster. As the temperature increases, the luminosity remains roughly constant, and when the exposed core reaches 30,000 K, half of the Sun's mass is ionized into a planetary nebula, as if it were in a kind of blue cycle. Eventually our sun becomes a white dwarf star with a temperature exceeding 100,000 K. The white dwarf will slowly cool over trillions of years, and eventually the sun will become a black dwarf._

_At this point, the sun's life will completely come to an end._

### _Understand the evolution of The Earth:_
_***The evolution of the earth is based on Wikipedia information and Youtube author MrPlasma "[Timeline of the Earth: From its Formation to Destruction](https://youtu.be/Zn6fcA2JkPg?si=f7ygQW7oZY9VgrIB)"***_.

_The evolution of the Earth does not take into account other influences (such as the greenhouse effect, supernova explosions, large asteroids hitting the Earth and other random celestial events)
Other large-scale geological events are more predictable. Milankovitch's theory predicts that the planet will continue to undergo glacial periods at least until the Quaternary glaciation comes to an end. These periods are caused by the variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of Earth's Orbit.
As part of the ongoing supercontinent cycle, plate tectonics will probably result in a supercontinent in 250–350 million years. Sometime in the next 1.5–4.5 billion years, Earth's axial tilt may begin to undergo chaotic variations, with changes in the axial tilt of up to 90°.
In about one billion years, the solar luminosity will be 10% higher, causing the atmosphere to become a "moist greenhouse", resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans. As a likely consequence, plate tectonics and the entire carbon cycle will end. Following this event, in about 2–3 billion years, the planet's magnetic dynamo may cease, causing the magnetosphere to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of volatiles from the outer atmosphere. Four billion years from now, the increase in Earth's surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect, creating conditions more extreme than present-day Venus and heating Earth's surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on Earth will be extinct._

_***So, why is the temperature of the earth increasing so much? Please see the following two chemical formulas:***_

- **MgCO3 =△=MgO+CO2**

- **CaCO3=△=CaO+CO2**

_**Article 1: In this equation, Δ represents heat. MgCO3 (magnesium carbonate) decomposes into MgO (magnesium oxide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) under heating conditions.**_

_**Article 2: CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) decomposes into CaO (calcium oxide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) under heating conditions**_

_So, you know why the earth is heating up rapidly, right? A large amount of carbon dioxide produced by the decomposition of carbonates enters the earth's atmosphere will produce a serious greenhouse effect. At this time, the earth's surface temperature can reach 2400 degrees Celsius!
After the sun gradually enters the red giant stage, the strong solar wind will gradually strip away the earth's thick atmosphere...  Then the sun will undergo a helium flash, then enter the asymptotic giant stage, and finally become a white dwarf star._ 

_Our planet may be able to survive the repeated expansion and contraction of progressive giant stars..._

# Author's words:

Hello, I am very glad that you can download my Mod. The author of this Mod is a middle school student from Guangzhou, China (yes, it is indeed a middle school student). The original intention of making this mod was to commemorate my existence and leave as many traces as possible in this world. Because she lives in an unhappy family, which makes a lot of noise every day. In such a family, all my family members and relatives will not feel the importance of mental health. They never cared about my mental health, they just thought there was nothing wrong with me because I was alive. I feel like I shouldn’t have depression at my age. Unfortunately, I already have severe depression and severe anxiety. I have also communicated with my mother and grandmother about this, but unfortunately they still don't care and don't take me to see a doctor. I even think that taking antidepressant drugs will affect my health.

In addition, my family also has a serious preference for boys over girls. They only think that if their children are male, they will have face, but if their children are female, they will lose face. Unfortunately, I didn’t graduate from junior high school, so they didn’t allow me to continue going to school. They asked me to leave that middle school and go to a vocational and technical school to study mechatronics technology, and asked me to do my father’s job. But as a woman, I , I don’t like mechatronics at all, what I like is art. But my parents don't agree with me studying art. They want me to earn my own money and learn what I like, so they can only choose what they want for me. During the five years I was in school, I encountered school violence and color discrimination from my classmates every day. Family members and teachers ignored the matter. Never took it seriously. It lasts from 2019 to 2023. Over the past five years, my mental state has gotten worse and worse, until now, I have no motivation to do almost anything.

I am becoming a waste, trying to save myself but unable to do anything. I have no friends in real life, let alone anyone to talk to... I have almost no money now. I can only rely on extra part-time jobs to earn some pocket money.
If you like my Mods, please sponsor me some... 
Thank you
