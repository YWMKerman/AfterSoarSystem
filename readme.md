# _****Introduction****_

  AfterSolarSystem (ASS for short) is the last glorious moment of the sun as a star. It roughly predicts what may happen in billions of years based on the current situation of our solar system. Maybe it can become a fan work of RealSolarSystem and BeforeSolarSystem.
  
  In the timeline of AfterSolarSystem, the sun has just left the Subgiant stage and entered the red giant stage. At this time, the sun's habitable zone is moving outside the asteroid belt. Today, the temperatures of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto have risen enough to melt ice into liquid water, allowing them to briefly have thin atmospheres and liquid water oceans. However, almost no one chooses Stay on these three satellites.
They continued toward the outer solar system and reached Titan. Before the solar helium flash, it would be the last refuge for humans in the solar system. The seeds of life will be sown on this satellite. However, at this moment, there is still the last scientific expedition team lingering on Mars, but it will not be long before they have to leave here.Because the ocean of this world is boiling and evaporating at this moment. Before long, this world's flora and fauna will die.  In addition to this, Those celestial bodies at the edge of the distant solar system are also quietly changing under the subtle influence of the sun. Some gases that once existed in solid form are melting, and oceans composed of liquid gas have appeared on the dark and distant world. We know very little about those mysterious dark worlds, which are waiting for us to explore and unearth that unknown dusty history...

## ***Advantage***

Compared with RealSolarSystem, AfterSolarSystem simulates the situation of the solar system billions years later, but it adds many assumptions and ideas. For example, colonizing Mars, terraforming Titan, capturing rogue planets, some hypothetical celestial bodies in the solar system, etc... Although these science fiction ideas are divorced from the rationality of reality, they make the game more interesting, and in contrast, RealSolarSystem Because it is the solar system at this moment, it is imprisoned in reality. Therefore, you may feel boring and lifeless when playing RealSolarSystem...    But this phenomenon will not completely appear on AfterSolarSystem.  In AfterSolarSysyem Mod, almost every celestial body surface has surface structural features such as plants, rocks, and ice Thorns, floating islands, etc., as well as a variety of liquid lakes, such as liquid nitrogen lakes, metallic water, metallic hydrogen lakes, etc.  AfterSolarSystem even allows you to land in the core of a gaseous planet... In addition, there are some high temperature, extremely high atmospheric pressure celestial bodies waiting for you to explore...  This will make your gaming experience more interesting, let's act Get up

### _***AfterSolarSystem is compatible with (or provides support for) the following mods:***_
- [Environmental Visual Enhancements](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases)
- [Scatterer](https://spacedock.info/mod/141/Scatterer)
- [Distant Object Enhancement](https://spacedock.info/mod/2274/Distant%20Object%20Enhancement%20Continued)
- [TUFX](https://github.com/shadowmage45/TUFX/releases)
- [Parallax 1.3.1](https://github.com/Gameslinx/Tessellation/releases)
- [Stock Volumetric Clouds](https://www.patreon.com/posts/true-volumetric-77198227)
- [KerbalKonstructs](https://github.com/KSP-RO/Kerbal-Konstructs/releases)


### _***AfterSolarSystem is not compatible with the following mods:***_
- External visual mods (RVE, RSSVE, EVO, etc.)
- External planet mods (RealSolarSystem, AfterKerbin, BeyondHome, etc.)
- Principia

### _***Performance requirements:***_
  *Does AfterSolarSystem Mod require the same or higher computer performance than RealSolarSystem?* 
  
  Not exactly, when AfterSolarSystem Mod is used with scatterer and StockVolumetricClouds Mod, the RAM usage of the computer is only less than 6GB. It even runs on my grandmother's 2015 Samsung laptop (i5-5005U, DDR3 8G RAM, 500GB HDD, Intel HD Graphics). 
  So it does not require high performance on your computer.  But considering that it is a Solar System rather than a Kerbol System, **if you need to play with the Realism Overhaul series of Mods, you will need at least 16GB of RAM or higher.**
 
So , I **recommend** that your computer best meet the following requirements:

- Have at least 4 CPU cores.
- Greater than or equal to 8G RAM
- GPU with 2GB or more VRAM

# Author's words:

Hello, I am very glad that you can download my Mod. The author of this Mod is a middle school student from Guangzhou, China (yes, it is indeed a middle school student). The original intention of making this mod was to commemorate my existence and leave as many traces as possible in this world. Because she lives in an unhappy family, which makes a lot of noise every day. In such a family, all my family members and relatives will not feel the importance of mental health. They never cared about my mental health, they just thought there was nothing wrong with me because I was alive. I feel like I shouldn’t have depression at my age. Unfortunately, I already have severe depression and severe anxiety. I have also communicated with my mother and grandmother about this, but unfortunately they still don't care and don't take me to see a doctor. I even think that taking antidepressant drugs will affect my health.

In addition, my family also has a serious preference for boys over girls. They only think that if their children are male, they will have face, but if their children are female, they will lose face. Unfortunately, I didn’t graduate from junior high school, so they didn’t allow me to continue going to school. They asked me to leave that middle school and go to a vocational and technical school to study mechatronics technology, and asked me to do my father’s job. But as a woman, I , I don’t like mechatronics at all, what I like is art. But my parents don't agree with me studying art. They want me to earn my own money and learn what I like, so they can only choose what they want for me. During the five years I was in school, I encountered school violence and color discrimination from my classmates every day. Family members and teachers ignored the matter. Never took it seriously. It lasts from 2019 to 2023. Over the past five years, my mental state has gotten worse and worse, until now, I have no motivation to do almost anything.

I am becoming a waste, trying to save myself but unable to do anything. I have no friends in real life, let alone anyone to talk to... I have almost no money now. I can only rely on extra part-time jobs to earn some pocket money.
If you like my Mods, please sponsor me some... 
Thank you
