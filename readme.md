# _****Introduction****_
***AfterSolarSystem Mod is based on the current situation of our solar system and estimates what the solar system may look like in 7.9 billion years. This Mod is based on the "[History and Future of the Solar System](https://youtu.be/d27exZfXzsc?si=KvIiFQNL578fBlLS)" video by YouTube video author Algol with certain modifications. Some other references have been added to it, such as: the increase in the eccentricity of Mars' orbit and the colors of the four gaseous planets Change, capture rogue planets, etc...***

_Our sun is a G2V main sequence star. As a main sequence star, its mass occupies 99.86 of the solar system. The Sun is estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs. As a G2V main sequence star, our sun has a lifespan of approximately 10 billion years. The sun is currently 4.6 billion years old. In about 5-6 billion years, when our sun will have exhausted the hydrogen in its core, hydrogen fusion in the core will cease and there will be nothing to stop the core from shrinking. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the sun's luminosity to increase, end the main sequence stage, and cause the sun to gradually expand, first becoming a subgiant and then a red giant. At the same time, heating caused by gravitational contraction will also cause hydrogen fusion in the shell outside the core. The unfused hydrogen remains there, helping to increase the luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1,000 times the current brightness! The expansion of the volume will cause Mercury to move in the sun's atmosphere. Eventually, the high temperature will destroy Mercury, and Mercury will be engulfed by the sun._

_As our sun expands, the orbits of other planets will gradually shift outward due to the mass loss of the sun itself. After the red giant branch, the Sun has about 120 million years of active life left, but a lot has happened: "During the stage of red giant evolution, the nuclear fusion of hydrogen ceases in the core as the hydrogen is depleted, leaving Helium-rich core. However, the fusion of hydrogen continues in the shell outside the core, and the produced helium will continue to accumulate into the core, making the core denser. But unlike massive stars, the temperature can never reach helium level of fusion, so the helium fusion reaction does not begin. This causes the thermal pressure generated by nuclear fusion to no longer be sufficient to resist gravitational collapse, creating the hydrostatic equilibrium found in most stars. This causes the star to begin to shrink and The temperature is increased until it is finally compressed enough for the helium core to become degenerate. This degeneracy pressure is finally enough to prevent further collapse of the centermost material, but the rest of the core continues to shrink and the temperature continues to rise. Until the point where the helium fusion reaction can be ignited and helium fusion begins. Explosive helium flash originates from degenerate matter. Once the temperature reaches 100 million to 200 million K, helium fusion will begin to proceed in the 3-helium process, and the temperature will increase rapidly. Rise, further increasing the helium fusion rate, and because degenerate matter is a good heat conductor, the reaction area will expand._   _However, since degenerate pressure (which is purely a function of density) dominates over thermal pressure (which is proportional to the product of density and temperature), the dependence of the total pressure on temperature is rather weak. Therefore, a sudden increase in temperature results in only a slight increase in pressure, so the core does not cool down with steady expansion.
The rate of this runaway reaction can climb to about 100 billion times normal energy production in a matter of seconds, but degenerate matter is not eliminated until the temperature rises to the point where thermal pressure once again dominates. The core can then expand and cool, and helium burning will stabilize and continue. ” So our sun will have a helium flash.   After the helium flash, the Sun shrank to about 10 times its current size, 50 times its luminosity, and was a little cooler than it is now. It will then reach the Red clump, or horizontal branch, but stars with solar metallicity will not evolve toward blue along the horizontal branch. On the contrary, as it continues to react with helium in the core. When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core is exhausted. This time, however, it all happened faster, the sun became bigger and brighter, and if Venus had survived the sun's red giant phase before, it might be doomed now. This is the Asymptotic Giant Branch Star stage (abbreviated as AGB stage). After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun became increasingly unstable, rapidly losing mass and increasing in size and luminosity every 100,000 years or so for hundreds of years due to thermal pulses. The thermal pulses grew larger each time, with subsequent pulses pushing the luminosity to 5,000 times its current level and a radius of more than 1 AU! The Sun would then become the brightest star in the night sky. For our Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer shell and begins to form a planetary nebula. By the end of this phase, which lasts about 500,000 years, the Sun will eventually have only about half its current mass. The later evolution of the asymptotic megabranch is even faster. As the temperature increases, the luminosity remains roughly constant, and when the exposed core reaches 30,000 K, half of the Sun's mass is ionized into a planetary nebula, as if it were in a kind of blue cycle. Eventually our sun becomes a white dwarf star with a temperature exceeding 100,000 K. The white dwarf will slowly cool over trillions of years, and eventually the sun will become a black dwarf._

_At this point, the sun's life will completely come to an end._


_In this mod, the time is set to when the sun in in its initial AGB (Asymptotic Giant Branch) phase. During the phase, the sun becomes more and more unstable, and may erupt again at any time according the prediction. It will destroy all the surviving celestial bodies during successive eruptions and turn the solar system into ruins. Finally, the sun will end its AGB phase that lasted only 800 thousand years and become a white dwarf, making the solar system a dead silence._

### _***AfterSolarSystem is compatible with (or provides support for) the following mods:***_
- [Environmental Visual Enhancements](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases)
- [Scatterer](https://spacedock.info/mod/141/Scatterer)

### _***AfterSolarSystem is not compatible with the following mods:***_
- External visual mods (RVE, RSSVE, EVO, etc.)
- External planet mods (RealSolarSystem, AfterKerbin, BeyondHome, etc.)
- Principia

### _***Recommended mods to install:***_
- [KSPIE](https://spacedock.info/mod/172/KSP%20Interstellar%20Extended)
- [Better Time Warp](https://spacedock.info/mod/1162/BetterTimeWarpContinued)
*** 
_"After Solar System Mod" theoretically does not have very high performance requirements (in the case of only using Scatterer as a visual module), I can run relatively smoothly on a 2015 notebook of my grandmother, and the configuration of this notebook is I3-5005U 10GB DDR3 memory and Intel's core graphics card, 1TB mechanical hard disk. This may be the minimum requirement to ensure the visual situation as much as possible_
***Therefore my recommendation is:***
- Your processor needs to have at least 4 cores and 8 threads.
- RAM at least equal to or greater than 10GB
- It is best to use a graphics card with 2G or higher video memory
