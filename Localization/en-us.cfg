        #ASS_SunInSpaceLowcrewReport = You are slowly feeling that the temperature around you is rising rapidly, and the strong sunlight shining through the portholes makes it almost impossible to open your eyes. \nSo you put on your special sunglasses and looked out the porthole. You finally saw the true face of the huge red luminous sphere that had been hidden by the high light - it was a huge plasma that was constantly rolling. \n You begin to worry about whether the thin walls of the spacecraft can protect your safety.
        #ASS_SunInSpace =              Viewed from this position, the sun is the brightest star in the sky. You can easily see it even if you are dozens of light-years away. Its light is bright enough to eclipse other stars. However, that is just the glory before death of a star, and all stars will experience it.
        #ASS_SunInSpaceLowevaReport =  I feel my body temperature is rising rapidly. Can a space suit really keep me safe?
        #ASS_SunSunInSpaceevaReport =  It may be safe to look at the dazzling star at this distance, so you lower the visor on the visor of your space suit and stare at the star. A question pops up in your mind: "Will the sun really have a helium flash?"
        #ASS_SunFlyingcrewReport =  We are almost reaching the chromosphere, and you see the huge plasma rolling below. At the same time, you carefully pilot the spacecraft to avoid the sun's coronal mass ejections.
        #ASS_SunFlyingevaReport = "I want to fly into the sky and stand shoulder to shoulder with the sun. The world is waiting for me to change. I am not afraid of others seeing my dreams. I can achieve them here."

        #ASS_MercuryInSpace =               Look！ the planet is glowing dark red.
        #ASS_MercuryInSpaceLowevaReport =   You glanced outside and saw the rocks below that had turned dark red due to the high temperature, as well as the blazing sea of lava.
        #ASS_MercuryInSpaceevaReport =      Look, it's a Body that emits a faint red light. How dim and insignificant it is in front of the dazzling solar year.
        #ASS_MercurySrfLanded =             It seems like a desolate world, with only large rocks scattered here and there on the surface.
        #ASS_MercurySrfSplashedcrewReport = We are landing on hot lava, and the heat is making the inside of our ship feel like an oven.
        #ASS_MercuryevaSrfLanded =          The rocks under your feet look very soft, and it feels like you are stepping on them into a swamp. You also feel that it is very sticky.
        #ASS_MercurySrfSplashedevaReport =  I feel like I'm in danger

        #ASS_VenusInSpaceLowcrewReport =    A high-temperature hellish world whose surface is covered with lava, volcanoes, and giant rocks. \n I don’t want to go up there.
        #ASS_VenusInSpacecreawReport =      Look, it's a huge comet, and you notice a tail trailing behind this bright ‘star’.
        #ASS_VenusInSpaceLowevaReport =     You look down at the hellish world below and notice that its atmosphere is very thin and constantly being lost. By now you probably know how that comet tail comes into being.
        #ASS_VenusInSpaceevaReport =        It looks really beautiful, a glowing red planet with a long tail behind it. You pick up your camera and capture this scene. At the same time, you are thinking about how this comet tail is generated?
        #ASS_VenusFlyingcrewReport =        The thin atmosphere can hardly slow down our spacecraft. We are feeling the huge gravity. 
        #ASS_VenusFlyingevaReport =         I feel that my situation is very dangerous
        #ASS_VenusFlyingLowevaReport =      The rocks below look very hot, they are steaming.
        #ASS_VenusSrfLandedcrewReport =     The rocks below the ship seemed soft, but luckily we didn't sink in
        #ASS_VenusSrfSplashedcrewReport =   We are landing on hot lava, and the heat is making the inside of our ship feel like an oven.
        #ASS_VenusevaSrfLanded =            You are standing on "muddy", loose rocks, feeling the occasional hot wind that seems to be mixed with rock fragments.
        #ASS_VenusSrfSplashedevaReport =    I feel like I'm in danger

        #ASS_EarthInSpaceLowcrewReport =    Below you is a dazzling yellow Body, shrouded in thick clouds that make it almost impossible to peek through to see what's going on below.
        #ASS_EarthInSpacecrewReport =       Is that a star?
        #ASS_EarthInSpaceLowevaReport =     You stare at the celestial body below, and you find that you can barely see any details. When you lower the sun visor and look again, you finally see the details in the clouds clearly. It is a huge cyclone. Even if you are at such an orbital altitude, it is still so huge. It is rotating and moving rapidly...
        #ASS_EarthInSpaceevaReport =        It looked so bright, almost like a red dwarf star.
        #ASS_EarthFlyingcrewReport =        The pressure and temperature alarms on the spacecraft kept sounding like crazy. The density of the surrounding atmosphere is getting higher and higher. Can we still go home?
        #ASS_EarthSrfLandedcrewReport =     The huge air pressure seems to be crushing the spacecraft. You know clearly that only the thin wall on the spacecraft can guarantee your safety, but outside the thin wall is a hellish environment. You try to look outside through the porthole, but all you can see is yellow fog.
        #ASS_EarthFlyingevaReport =         I think my situation at the moment is very dangerous
        #ASS_EarthSrfSplashedcrewReport =   We landed in hot lava. The temperature here is extremely high. Won't our spaceship be burned down?
        #ASS_EarthFlyingLowevaReport =      The air pressure here is huge and the temperature is incredibly high. Even though I'm wearing a space suit, the high temperature still makes me covered in sweat.
        #ASS_EarthevaSrfLanded =            You are walking on this soft ground, and you find that the visibility here seems to be very low, and you can hardly see the terrain in the distance.
        #ASS_EarthSrfSplashedevaReport =    I feel like my situation is dangerous

        #ASS_MoonInSpaceLowcrewReport =     Through the porthole, you are looking for something on the moon with a telescope, and are trying to find the lunar landing craft and probes left behind by humans on the moon.
        #ASS_MoonInSpace =                  Looking at this familiar yet unfamiliar Moon outside the window, you are reminded of a section of a poem written by a Chinese poet billions of years ago: "When you are young, you don't know the moon, and you call it a white jade plate."
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceLowevaReport =      You stare carefully at the moon below the spacecraft, trying to find something. Suddenly you find a long trace on the moon. You initially thought it was caused by rock sliding, but after seeing the detector at the end of the scratch, You gave up on the idea.
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceevaReport =         A desolate, cratered world with a handful of lava lakes, maybe it's not very hot?
        #ASS_MoonSrfLandedcrewReport =      We Choose To Go To The Moon！
        #ASS_MoonSrfSplashedcrewReport =    The rock here is melting, but it's not too hot yet, but you still have to be careful to avoid getting your spacecraft stuck in it.
        #ASS_MoonSrfLandedevaReport =       You set foot on this familiar and unfamiliar land, and the scene of the first human landing on the moon emerges in your mind. You turn your head and look at the footprints behind you, as if you have returned to the moment of the first moon landing in human history. All of this is so familiar.
        #ASS_MoonSrfSplashedevaReport =     The lava does not seem to be very hot, but it is very soft. It has already trapped me in it. I have to move carefully and slowly to avoid being sunk deeper.

        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowcreawReport =    We have reached the low orbit of Mars, and Mars comes into view outside the window. You now begin to let go of your hands and feel the weightlessness.
        #ASS_MarsInSpace =                  Through the porthole, you try to start looking for traces of Mars' two moons, Phobos, Deimos
        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowevaReport =      "Your sky is my horizon."
        #ASS_MarsInSpacevaReport =          From this height, you can have a sweeping view of Mars.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReport =         Look, it’s a white cloud!
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedcrewReport =      We’re home~
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashedcrewReport =    You see the waves outside the porthole slapping against the outer wall of the spacecraft. Maybe we should wait in the spacecraft for rescue to arrive? But before that maybe we could go for a swim?
        #ASS_MarsFlyingLowevaReport =       The situation seems dangerous, but you still have the courage to embrace the blue sky.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingevaReport =          The situation seems dangerous
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedevaReport =       You couldn't wait to take off your helmet, breathing in the fresh air. At the same time, you saw a Bianhua flower in the land not far away. You stepped forward, took it off, and put it on your head.
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashedevaReport =     The water here is so warm, it's like soaking in a hot spring.

        #ASS_PhobopsInSpaceLowcreawReport = If you look closely, you will see that its surface is covered with many cracks and craters, showing how small it is.
        #ASS_PhobopsInSpace =               Is that really a Moon? Or a huge rock floating in the orbit of Mars?
        #ASS_PhobosInSpaceevaReport =       It looks like a large rock floating alone in the orbit of Mars.
        #ASS_PhobosSrfLandedevaReport =     Here, you are careful every step you take, because if you are not careful, you will drift into outer space
        #ASS_PhobosSrfLandedcrewReport =    Did our spaceship land?

        #ASS_DeimosInSpaceLowcreawReport =  I seemed to be able to reach its surface directly using the jetpack, and the landing craft seemed a bit redundant here.
        #ASS_DeimosInSpace =                A speck of space dust? So interesting. You start observing the celestial body using the telescope on the spacecraft.
        #ASS_DeimosInSpaceevaReport =       The tiny world below seemed to be attracting me to land directly in it using the propulsion system on my space suit.
        #ASS_DeimosSrfLandedcrewReport =    Maybe we don’t need to fly a spaceship to land on this satellite at all
        #ASS_DeimosSrfLandedevaReport =     The gravity here is so small, it is so difficult to walk on it, because if you are not careful, you will escape from this satellite

        #ASS_CeresInSpaceLowcreawReport =   The world below seemed to be made of white. At the same time, you noticed that there are many ancient craters and countless gullies and ice spikes on it. \nWait a minute, I seem to have found a snowman up there? !
        #ASS_CeresInSpace =                 From this altitude, Ceres looks like a giant white snowball, just like the one on your ice cream. You're wondering what it would taste like to take a lick.
        #ASS_CeresInSpaceLowevaReport =     You notice that the white world below is dotted with countless light blue ice spikes. They look very tall and very huge.
        #ASS_CeresInSpaceevaReport =        You stare at Ceres, the dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, and at the same time, you think about the ice cream you just had.
        #ASS_CeresSrfLandedcrewReport =     Through the porthole, you see a white and desolate world outside. There are also many large, sharp ice cubes dotted here and there in light blue.
        #ASS_CeresSrfLandedevaReport =      A lonely, desolate, and cool world. \nThis seems to be a dead world. Your eyes begin to be attracted by the world below your feet. You begin to try to cut through the ice to explore the liquid water ocean under the ice.
    
        #ASS_MunaInSpaceLowcrawReport =     The planet outside the porthole window is just like our home, with rivers and lakes, mountains and plains, and a thick atmosphere. Gradually it attracts you, making you eager to colonize it.
        #ASS_MunaInSpacecrewReport =        Its surface appears to be covered in liquid water, as well as a massive ice cap, and it appears to have two moons.
        #ASS_MunaFlyingcrewReport =         Oh my god, it actually has oxygen in its atmosphere! We don't even need a spacesuit to move around on it. \n After being shocked, you regain your composure and begin to set up the takeoff and landing procedures for the spacecraft.
        #ASS_MunaSrfLandedcrewReport =      The sensors on the spacecraft once again confirmed this, this is a habitable world with an oxygenated atmosphere and a suitable temperature. But the temperature is a little low, so you may need to wear thick clothes to keep warm when going outside. At this moment you can't wait to go outside.
        #ASS_MunaSrfSplashedcrewReport =    Landing here seems a bit bad and you start to worry if the spaceship is going to sink to the bottom.
        #ASS_MunaInSpaceLowevaReport =      The world below is such a beautiful, inviting and huge world. It attracts you deeply.
        #ASS_MunaInSpaceevaReport =         blue marbles
        #ASS_MunaFlyingevaReport =          I think it's time for me to get back on the spaceship.
        #ASS_MunaFlyingLowevaReport =       Looking at the charming world below, you are so excited that you reach out your hands and try to touch the white clouds.
        #ASS_MunaevaSrfLanded =             You can't wait to get out of the spacecraft and take a big breath. At the same time, you find that the air pressure here seems to be slightly higher than that of Mars. Then a gust of cold wind blew by and you shivered.
        #ASS_MunaSrfSplashedevaReport =     The water seems to be a bit cold.

        #ASS_MinmausInSpaceLowcreawReport = A dim red moon. Maybe it is a treasure land rich in mineral resources?
        #ASS_MinmausInSpace =               Muna looks huge in the sky.
        #ASS_MinmausSrfLandedcrewReport =   Through the porthole, you observe that the ground is filled with rocks of various sizes. They greatly increase the difficulty of landing, and in addition there are numerous cracks several centimeters wide.
        #ASS_MinmausInSpaceLowevaReport =   You notice that the material on its surface seems to have many different types of sediment mixed together. There are many stones of different sizes scattered across the surface
        #ASS_MinmausInSpaceevaReport =      Its shape looks like an egg, perhaps due to Muna's tidal forces.
        #ASS_MinmausSrfLandedevaReport =    You look up to find any trace of Muna, and at the same time, you feel how small you are.

        #ASS_MollInSpaceLowcreawReport =    A gray world with many craters on its surface, and its mass seems to be close to that of Mercury. Hopefully you don't try to land with a jetpack.
        #ASS_MollInSpace =                  A gray moon, its size and mass are so huge that we can’t help but wonder whether it is a satellite or a companion star.
        #ASS_MollSrfLandedcrewReport =      You have landed in this gray world. Through the porthole, you see the outside world. It seems to be very similar to the moon. It is really a good place to stage a fake moon landing.
        #ASS_MollInSpaceLowevaReport =      You noticed that the gray land below is covered with dense craters. Their existence will greatly affect the landing of large spacecraft in the future. \nPerhaps these craters can illustrate how old this world is.
        #ASS_MollInSpaceevaReport =         It looks huge, even though it's still far away it looks so big
        #ASS_MollSrfLandedevaReport =       You try to jump and find that its gravity seems to be almost the same as that of our home planet. Is this really a satellite? Should it be called Muna’s companion star?
   
        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceLowcrawReport =  At this distance, Jupiter appears so huge that we can barely see its edges. Through the portholes, all you can see is Jupiter's turbulent cloud belts. There are countless high-speed rotating storms in the cloud belts, and they are raging crazily. \nAt the same time, you start to worry, can our spacecraft withstand Jupiter's deadly radiation?
        #ASS_JupiterInSpacecrewReport =     You see the largest planet in the solar system, see its beautiful streaks and its huge, rapidly rotating storms, and feel Jupiter's immense gravity pulling on us. \nAt the same time, you start to observe Jupiter with a telescope, and you see 4 Galilean satellites and nearly a hundred small moons dancing slowly around Jupiter.
        #ASS_JupiterFlyingcrewReport =      You feel that the huge gravity is pressing you down on the seat. At this moment, you are almost sinking into the seat. Every time you raise your hand, it is so laborious and difficult.

        #ASS_JupiterFlyingLowevaReport =    The huge air pressure seems to be crushing me. I feel that the density and temperature of the gas around me are getting higher and higher. It seems very dark here, and the sunlight cannot penetrate the thick clouds. I can barely see my fingers. Only the occasional strong lightning could illuminate the dark surroundings. \nAt the same time, I felt strong winds blowing against me, as if they were going to blow the spacecraft apart. \nWill I die? \nNo, I want to go home.
   
        #ASS_IoInSpaceLowcreawReport =      Through the porthole, you can see at least dozens of active volcanoes, which are slowly spilling lava, and you know that they may erupt at any time.

        #ASS_SaturnInSpaceLowevaReport =    The orange world below looks very peaceful, and you have been looking for a long time but you haven't found a big storm. So your telescope turns to the rings of Saturn, and suddenly, you spot several celestial objects shaped like goose eggs.
        #ASS_SaturnInSpaceevaReport =       You see a huge light blue halo, how beautiful it is, reflecting beautiful colors under the sun. You can't help but try to reach out and touch it.
        #ASS_SaturnFlyingLowevaReport =     Through the thick clouds, you see the ocean below, a sea of liquid metallic hydrogen that reaches thousands of degrees. \nSuddenly, you see several huge floating islands in the sky over Saturn not far away. You are thinking, how do they float?
        #ASS_SaturnFlyingevaReport =        Looking at the rolling sea of liquid metal hydrogen under your feet, you are very scared, because you know what the consequences will be if you fall.
        #ASS_SaturnevaSrfLanded =           You are standing on an unknown island in shock, thinking to yourself, the existence here is really incredible, are we really still alive? Or is everything before us an illusion and we are already dead?

        #ASS_MinasInSpace =                 You discovered that there is a huge crater on the surface of Mimas, maybe it suffered a huge impact. \n You are marveling at how huge this crater is. Even though you are still relatively far away from Mimas at the moment, this crater is still so huge and obvious.
        #ASS_MinasSrfLandedcrewReport =     The ground of the world outside the porthole is scattered with many sharp and tiny gravels. Although they do not pose a threat to our spacecraft, they will bring great safety hazards to subsequent outdoor activities.
        #ASS_MimasInSpaceLowevaReport =     It looks very uneven, which may mean that if you need to land, landing in the huge crater may be the best option.
        #ASS_MimasInSpaceevaReport =        Its shape looks distinctly flat. Its surface has a huge crater, many cracks, and numerous peaks.
        #ASS_MimasSrfLandedevaReport =      Be careful with every step you take, because once you fall on the sharp ice, your spacesuit is likely to be damaged, causing oxygen leakage.

        #ASS_SaturnIIInSpaceLowcreawReport = You observe that there are many cracks on the surface of Enceladus. They are very deep, as if they lead straight to hell.

        #ASS_SaturnIIInSpace =              You find that this space snowball is erupting volcanically, but the eruption is water. The violent volcanic eruption will eject a large amount of water and ice mixture from the cracks. This ice-water mixture escapes Enceladus at very high speeds and enters the orbit of Saturn, constantly replenishing the material in Saturn's outer rings. We might have to be careful if we go near it. Be careful not to get hit by the erupted material.
        #ASS_SaturnIISrfLandedcrewReport =  You stand in this cold world, looking up at the stars. and Saturn's outer rings, which glow a pale blue in the darkness.
        #ASS_SaturnIIInSpaceLowevaReport =  You look at the cracks below and realize that they are so deep that even the sun cannot shine into the depths of the cracks. Suddenly you notice a large amount of water-ice mixture erupting from a distant crack, and you notice that these eruptions are escaping Enceladus at very high speeds. The height of the eruption is much higher than the orbital height of our spacecraft, and you start to worry about whether the cracks below will suddenly erupt.
        #ASS_SaturnIIInSpaceevaReport =     From this distance, the satellite appears to be smooth and has few surface blemishes.
        #ASS_SaturnIISrfLandedevaReport =   You are standing on the ice of Enceladus, looking at the geyser-like mixture of ice and water erupting in the distance. You try to carve through the thick ice to fish.
