        #ASS_SunInSpaceLowcrewReport = You are slowly feeling that the temperature around you is rising rapidly, and the strong sunlight shining through the portholes makes it almost impossible to open your eyes. \nSo you put on your special sunglasses and looked out the porthole. You finally saw the true face of the huge red luminous sphere that had been hidden by the high light - it was a huge plasma that was constantly rolling. \n You begin to worry about whether the thin walls of the spacecraft can protect your safety.
        #ASS_SunInSpace =              Viewed from this position, the sun is the brightest star in the sky. You can easily see it even if you are dozens of light-years away. Its light is bright enough to eclipse other stars. However, that is just the glory before death of a star, and all stars will experience it.
        #ASS_SunInSpaceLowevaReport =  I feel my body temperature is rising rapidly. Can a space suit really keep me safe?
        #ASS_SunSunInSpaceevaReport =  It may be safe to look at the dazzling star at this distance, so you lower the visor on the visor of your space suit and stare at the star. A question pops up in your mind: "Will the sun really have a helium flash?"
        #ASS_SunFlyingcrewReport =  We are almost reaching the chromosphere, and you see the huge plasma rolling below. At the same time, you carefully pilot the spacecraft to avoid the sun's coronal mass ejections.
        #ASS_SunFlyingevaReport = "I want to fly into the sky and stand shoulder to shoulder with the sun. The world is waiting for me to change. I am not afraid of others seeing my dreams. I can achieve them here."

        #ASS_MercuryInSpaceLowcrewReport =  You look down at the charred surface and observe some geological structures you've never seen before.
        #ASS_MercuryInSpace =               Look！ the planet is glowing dark red.
        #ASS_MercuryInSpaceLowevaReport =   You glanced outside and saw the rocks below that had turned dark red due to the high temperature, as well as the blazing sea of lava.
        #ASS_MercuryInSpaceevaReport =      Look, it's a Body that emits a faint red light. How dim and insignificant it is in front of the dazzling solar year.
        #ASS_MercurySrfLanded =             It seems like a desolate world, with only large rocks scattered here and there on the surface.
        #ASS_MercurySrfSplashedcrewReport = We are landing on hot lava, and the heat is making the inside of our ship feel like an oven.
        #ASS_MercuryevaSrfLanded =          The rocks under your feet look very soft, and it feels like you are stepping on them into a swamp. You also feel that it is very sticky.
        #ASS_MercurySrfSplashedevaReport =  I feel like I'm in danger

        #ASS_VenusInSpaceLowcrewReport =    A high-temperature hellish world whose surface is covered with lava, volcanoes, and giant rocks. \n I don’t want to go up there.
        #ASS_VenusInSpacecreawReport =      Look, it's a huge comet, and you notice a tail trailing behind this bright ‘star’.
        #ASS_VenusInSpaceLowevaReport =     You look down at the hellish world below and notice that its atmosphere is very thin and constantly being lost. By now you probably know how that comet tail comes into being.
        #ASS_VenusInSpaceevaReport =        It looks really beautiful, a glowing red planet with a long tail behind it. You pick up your camera and capture this scene. At the same time, you are thinking about how this comet tail is generated?
        #ASS_VenusFlyingcrewReport =        The thin atmosphere can hardly slow down our spacecraft. We are feeling the huge gravity. 
        #ASS_VenusFlyingevaReport =         I feel that my situation is very dangerous
        #ASS_VenusFlyingLowevaReport =      The rocks below look very hot, they are steaming.
        #ASS_VenusSrfLandedcrewReport =     The rocks below the ship seemed soft, but luckily we didn't sink in
        #ASS_VenusSrfSplashedcrewReport =   We are landing on hot lava, and the heat is making the inside of our ship feel like an oven.
        #ASS_VenusevaSrfLanded =            You are standing on "muddy", loose rocks, feeling the occasional hot wind that seems to be mixed with rock fragments.
        #ASS_VenusSrfSplashedevaReport =    I feel like I'm in danger

        #ASS_EarthInSpaceLowcrewReport =    Below you is a dazzling yellow Body, shrouded in thick clouds that make it almost impossible to peek through to see what's going on below.
        #ASS_EarthInSpacecrewReport =       Is that a star?
        #ASS_EarthInSpaceLowevaReport =     You stare at the celestial body below, and you find that you can barely see any details. When you lower the sun visor and look again, you finally see the details in the clouds clearly. It is a huge cyclone. Even if you are at such an orbital altitude, it is still so huge. It is rotating and moving rapidly...
        #ASS_EarthInSpaceevaReport =        It looked so bright, almost like a red dwarf star.
        #ASS_EarthFlyingcrewReport =        The pressure and temperature alarms on the spacecraft kept sounding like crazy. The density of the surrounding atmosphere is getting higher and higher. Can we still go home?
        #ASS_EarthSrfLandedcrewReport =     The huge air pressure seems to be crushing the spacecraft. You know clearly that only the thin wall on the spacecraft can guarantee your safety, but outside the thin wall is a hellish environment. You try to look outside through the porthole, but all you can see is yellow fog.
        #ASS_EarthFlyingevaReport =         I think my situation at the moment is very dangerous
        #ASS_EarthSrfSplashedcrewReport =   We landed in hot lava. The temperature here is extremely high. Won't our spaceship be burned down?
        #ASS_EarthFlyingLowevaReport =      The air pressure here is huge and the temperature is incredibly high. Even though I'm wearing a space suit, the high temperature still makes me covered in sweat.
        #ASS_EarthevaSrfLanded =            You are walking on this soft ground, and you find that the visibility here seems to be very low, and you can hardly see the terrain in the distance.
        #ASS_EarthSrfSplashedevaReport =    I feel like my situation is dangerous
        #ASS_EarthSrfLandedcrewReportPanguland =    Through the porthole, you looked at a world that glowed dark red, and you tried to find something in it.
        #ASS_EarthSrfSplashedcrewReportPanguland =  Lava is boiling
        #ASS_EarthevaSrfLandedPanguland =           I feel as though the land is melting.
        #ASS_EarthInSpaceevaReportPanguland =       Even though thick clouds obscure the view below, you know that right below you is the oldest continent on the planet.

        #ASS_MoonInSpaceLowcrewReport =     Through the porthole, you are looking for something on the moon with a telescope, and are trying to find the lunar landing craft and probes left behind by humans on the moon.
        #ASS_MoonInSpace =                  Looking at this familiar yet unfamiliar Moon outside the window, you are reminded of a section of a poem written by a Chinese poet billions of years ago: "When you are young, you don't know the moon, and you call it a white jade plate."
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceLowevaReport =      You stare carefully at the moon below the spacecraft, trying to find something. Suddenly you find a long trace on the moon. You initially thought it was caused by rock sliding, but after seeing the detector at the end of the scratch, You gave up on the idea.
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceevaReport =         A desolate, cratered world with a handful of lava lakes, maybe it's not very hot?
        #ASS_MoonSrfLandedcrewReport =      We Choose To Go To The Moon！
        #ASS_MoonSrfSplashedcrewReport =    The rock here is melting, but it's not too hot yet, but you still have to be careful to avoid getting your spacecraft stuck in it.
        #ASS_MoonSrfLandedevaReport =       You set foot on this familiar and unfamiliar land, and the scene of the first human landing on the moon emerges in your mind. You turn your head and look at the footprints behind you, as if you have returned to the moment of the first moon landing in human history. All of this is so familiar.
        #ASS_MoonSrfSplashedevaReport =     The lava does not seem to be very hot, but it is very soft. It has already trapped me in it. I have to move carefully and slowly to avoid being sunk deeper.

        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowcreawReport =    We have reached the low orbit of Mars, and Mars comes into view outside the window. You now begin to let go of your hands and feel the weightlessness.
        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowcreawReport1 =   At this time, you are lying next to the window, trying to find traces of Phobos.
        #ASS_MarsInSpace =                  Through the porthole, you try to start looking for traces of Mars' two moons, Phobos, Deimos
        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowevaReport =      "Your sky is my horizon."
        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowevaReportCanyonsailor = You look at Valles Marineris below and for the first time you feel how huge it is
        #ASS_MarsInSpacevaReport =          From this height, you can have a sweeping view of Mars.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReport =         Look, it’s a white cloud!
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReportCanyonsailor = Look, Valles Marineris!
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedcrewReport =      We’re home~
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedcrewReportCanyonsailor = When you see the wide canyon through the porthole, you feel extremely shocked.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingLowevaReportCanyonsailor = Viewed from this height, this huge canyon is so beautiful.
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashedcrewReport =    You see the waves outside the porthole slapping against the outer wall of the spacecraft. Maybe we should wait in the spacecraft for rescue to arrive? But before that maybe we could go for a swim?
        #ASS_MarsFlyingLowevaReport =       The situation seems dangerous, but you still have the courage to embrace the blue sky.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingevaReport =          The situation seems dangerous
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedevaReport =       You couldn't wait to take off your helmet, breathing in the fresh air. At the same time, you saw a Bianhua flower in the land not far away. You stepped forward, took it off, and put it on your head.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedevaReportCanyonsailor = You feel that the air around Mariner Canyon is obviously much humid than other places, and the temperature is much lower. You felt a gust of cool breeze blowing up your long hair
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashedevaReport =     The water here is so warm, it's like soaking in a hot spring.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReportOlympus =  You fly past Mount Olympus, and through the porthole you see how huge it is. It looks higher than the atmosphere.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedcrewReportOlympus = You land on the mountainside of Mount Olympus. At this time, you find that you are at a very high altitude. The sky outside the window is no longer blue, but dark blue.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingevaReportOlympus =   The air pressure here seems to be very thin, and the effect of the parachute does not seem to be that obvious.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedevaReportOlympus = You are standing at such a high altitude and you are watching the eagles flying by in the sky. You realize how insignificant human existence is.
        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowevaReportOlympus = The mountain at the foot looks very huge, as if it extends out of outer space
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReportSwamp_ =       You are flying over a swamp and you notice a lot of vegetation below, please be careful if you are trying to find a landing spot.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandcrewReportSwamp_ =      The ground below appears to be very soft, and the spacecraft's landing left a distinct mark on the ground.
        #ASS_MarsSrfSokashedSwamp_ =            Your spaceship landed in the mud of the swamp, and the splashes you made made the spacecraft look very dirty.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedevaReportSwamp_ =     You are standing in a muddy swamp, and you hear a frog croaking not far away.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingevaReportSwamp_ =        The swamp below is so huge that you can’t even see the edge.
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashedSwamp_ =            You notice that the frog's noise seems to come from the water, maybe you can catch one.
        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowevaReportSwamp_ =    You notice that, as seen from space, there is a lot of green next to some bodies of water.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedevaReportMoran_Sea = The air near my hometown seems to be filled with fragrance
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashedevaReportMoran_Sea = Despite your familiarity with these waters, it can still be dangerous when venturing out for a swim.

        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReportTaerxisiHeightland = The plateau below looks very dead, with no vegetation, no soil, only yellow sand flying all over the sky.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedcrewReportTaerxisiHeightland = You notice that the temperature here is a bit hot and you feel a little dehydrated.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReportMoran_Sea = You see the familiar landform outside the window, and you recognize it at a glance as being near home
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedcrewReportMoran_Sea = Where our home is.
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashedcrewReportMoran_Sea = It’s time to wait for the rescue team to arrive.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReporthills = When you notice, outside the spacecraft is the vast Gobi Desert, with a large number of cacti
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReporthills = I think we should go back to the spacecraft. The hot desert may cause us to become dehydrated. We should go back to the spacecraft and wait for the search and rescue team.
        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowevaReporthills = You noticed the vast desert below
        #ASS_MarsFlyingLowevaReportCanyonsailorhills = How should we find our way home? Or wait for rescue.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedevaReporthills = You feel that the air around you is very hot and the sun above your head is very fierce.
        #ASS_MarsFlyingcrewReportOlympusProMax = Our vehicle can’t seem to get enough lift to get to the top of the mountain
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedcrewReportOlympusProMax = When you are at the top of the mountain, you realize how huge the mountain is.
        #ASS_MarsSrfLandedevaReportOlympusProMax = The oxygen here is so thin that you have to wear a space suit.
        #ASS_MarsInSpaceLowevaReportOlympusProMax = It almost extends to outer space
        #ASS_MarsFlyingLowevaReportOlympusProMax = You noticed that huge crater.

        #ASS_PhobopsInSpaceLowcreawReport = If you look closely, you will see that its surface is covered with many cracks and craters, showing how small it is.
        #ASS_PhobopsInSpace =               Is that really a Moon? Or a huge rock floating in the orbit of Mars?
        #ASS_PhobosInSpaceevaReport =       It looks like a large rock floating alone in the orbit of Mars.
        #ASS_PhobosSrfLandedevaReport =     Here, you are careful every step you take, because if you are not careful, you will drift into outer space
        #ASS_PhobosSrfLandedcrewReport =    Did our spaceship land?

        #ASS_DeimosInSpaceLowcreawReport =  I seemed to be able to reach its surface directly using the jetpack, and the landing craft seemed a bit redundant here.
        #ASS_DeimosInSpace =                A speck of space dust? So interesting. You start observing the celestial body using the telescope on the spacecraft.
        #ASS_DeimosInSpaceevaReport =       The tiny world below seemed to be attracting me to land directly in it using the propulsion system on my space suit.
        #ASS_DeimosSrfLandedcrewReport =    Maybe we don’t need to fly a spaceship to land on this satellite at all
        #ASS_DeimosSrfLandedevaReport =     The gravity here is so small, it is so difficult to walk on it, because if you are not careful, you will escape from this satellite

        #ASS_CeresInSpaceLowcreawReport =   The world below seemed to be made of white. At the same time, you noticed that there are many ancient craters and countless gullies and ice spikes on it. \nWait a minute, I seem to have found a snowman up there? !
        #ASS_CeresInSpace =                 From this altitude, Ceres looks like a giant white snowball, just like the one on your ice cream. You're wondering what it would taste like to take a lick.
        #ASS_CeresInSpaceLowevaReport =     You notice that the white world below is dotted with countless light blue ice spikes. They look very tall and very huge.
        #ASS_CeresInSpaceevaReport =        You stare at Ceres, the dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, and at the same time, you think about the ice cream you just had.
        #ASS_CeresSrfLandedcrewReport =     Through the porthole, you see a white and desolate world outside. There are also many large, sharp ice cubes dotted here and there in light blue.
        #ASS_CeresSrfLandedevaReport =      A lonely, desolate, and cool world. \nThis seems to be a dead world. Your eyes begin to be attracted by the world below your feet. You begin to try to cut through the ice to explore the liquid water ocean under the ice.
    
        #ASS_MunaInSpaceLowcrawReport =     The planet outside the porthole window is just like our home, with rivers and lakes, mountains and plains, and a thick atmosphere. Gradually it attracts you, making you eager to colonize it.
        #ASS_MunaInSpacecrewReport =        Its surface appears to be covered in liquid water, as well as a massive ice cap, and it appears to have two moons.
        #ASS_MunaFlyingcrewReport =         Oh my god, it actually has oxygen in its atmosphere! We don't even need a spacesuit to move around on it. \n After being shocked, you regain your composure and begin to set up the takeoff and landing procedures for the spacecraft.
        #ASS_MunaSrfLandedcrewReport =      The sensors on the spacecraft once again confirmed this, this is a habitable world with an oxygenated atmosphere and a suitable temperature. But the temperature is a little low, so you may need to wear thick clothes to keep warm when going outside. At this moment you can't wait to go outside.
        #ASS_MunaSrfSplashedcrewReport =    Landing here seems a bit bad and you start to worry if the spaceship is going to sink to the bottom.

        #ASS_MunaFlyingLowevaReport =       Looking at the charming world below, you are so excited that you reach out your hands and try to touch the white clouds.
        #ASS_MunaevaSrfLanded =             You can't wait to get out of the spacecraft and take a big breath. At the same time, you find that the air pressure here seems to be slightly higher than that of Mars. Then a gust of cold wind blew by and you shivered.
        #ASS_MunaSrfSplashedevaReport =     The water seems to be a bit cold.
        #ASS_MunaFlyingcrewReportYuanqian =     You observed an abandoned base not far away, and you remembered the experience of this area of the earth at the same longitude and latitude more than 7 billion years ago.

        #ASS_MunaFlyingcrewReportJiOcean =      This sea seems very attractive.
        #ASS_MunaSrfSplashedevaReportJiOcean =  It is dangerous to dive into the water to find underwater ruins because you don’t know whether there are unknown creatures underwater.
        #ASS_MunaFlyingevaReportJiOcean =       You are flying above this blue sea, you may want to be careful because the weather near the ocean is prone to unpredictable weather.
        #ASS_MunaInSpaceLowevaReportJiOcean =   Is there life in the ocean below?

        #ASS_MinmausSrfLandedcrewReport =   Through the porthole, you observe that the ground is filled with rocks of various sizes. They greatly increase the difficulty of landing, and in addition there are numerous cracks several centimeters wide.
        #ASS_MinmausInSpaceLowevaReport =   You notice that the material on its surface seems to have many different types of sediment mixed together. There are many stones of different sizes scattered across the surface
        #ASS_MinmausInSpaceevaReport =      Its shape looks like an egg, perhaps due to Muna's tidal forces.
        #ASS_MinmausSrfLandedevaReport =    You look up to find any trace of Muna, and at the same time, you feel how small you are.

        #ASS_MollInSpaceLowcreawReport =    A gray world with many craters on its surface, and its mass seems to be close to that of Mercury. Hopefully you don't try to land with a jetpack.

        #ASS_MollSrfLandedcrewReport =      You have landed in this gray world. Through the porthole, you see the outside world. It seems to be very similar to the moon. It is really a good place to stage a fake moon landing.
        #ASS_MollInSpaceLowevaReport =      You noticed that the gray land below is covered with dense craters. Their existence will greatly affect the landing of large spacecraft in the future. \nPerhaps these craters can illustrate how old this world is.
        #ASS_MollInSpaceevaReport =         It looks huge, even though it's still far away it looks so big
        #ASS_MollSrfLandedevaReport =       You try to jump and find that its gravity seems to be almost the same as that of our home planet. Is this really a satellite? Should it be called Muna’s companion star?
   
        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceLowcrawReport =  At this distance, Jupiter appears so huge that we can barely see its edges. Through the portholes, all you can see is Jupiter's turbulent cloud belts.

        #ASS_JupiterInSpacecrewReport =     You see the largest planet in the solar system, see its beautiful streaks and its huge, rapidly rotating storms, and feel Jupiter's immense gravity pulling on us. \nAt the same time, you start to observe Jupiter with a telescope, and you see 4 Galilean satellites and nearly a hundred small moons dancing slowly around Jupiter.
        #ASS_JupiterFlyingcrewReport =      You feel that the huge gravity is pressing you down on the seat. At this moment, you are almost sinking into the seat. Every time you raise your hand, it is so laborious and difficult.
        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceLowevaReport =   Jupiter is so huge that you'd think it was flat. \nYou turn your head and look at the crazy and raging storms on Jupiter. Each of them is so huge that they are even as big as the Earth.
        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceevaReport =      As you stare at the gas planet and the stars in the sky in the background of Jupiter, you feel the insignificance of human beings and the vastness of the universe. You'll also notice that Jupiter also has a ring, but it doesn't seem as obvious.

        #ASS_JupiterFlyingLowevaReport =    The huge air pressure seems to be crushing me. I feel that the density and temperature of the gas around me are getting higher and higher. It seems very dark here, and the sunlight cannot penetrate the thick clouds. I can barely see my fingers. Only the occasional strong lightning could illuminate the dark surroundings. \nAt the same time, I felt strong winds blowing against me, as if they were going to blow the spacecraft apart. \nWill I die? \nNo, I want to go home.

        #ASS_JupiterFlyingevaReportPR =         I'm falling into the stormy world below, hoping I won't be torn apart by the hurricane.
        #ASS_JupiterFlyingevaReportTB =         A few drops of water appeared on your helmet, but disappeared quickly.
        #ASS_JupiterFlyingevaReportEB =         The red cloud surrounding me looks scary.

        #ASS_IoInSpaceevaReport =           You feel like you are getting a slight dizziness or headache. You think you might just be sick with a cold.
        #ASS_IoSrfLandedevaReport =         When you are moving around on this celestial body, the vital signs detection system in the spacesuit has been ringing. Although the gravity here is not high, you still feel like you are stepping on cotton, every time Lifting my legs was so difficult.
        #ASS_IoSrfLandedcrewReportLavaLake = You have noticed that your ship is around a crater, which may be dangerous. \nThrough the porthole, you can see lava slowly emerging from the ground not far away, but a large amount of lava may erupt at any time.
        #ASS_IoInSpaceLowevaReportLavaLake = When you are groggy at this moment and see the volcano slowly emitting lava below, you immediately become clear. The only thing you want to do at this moment is to return to the spacecraft immediately and leave this dangerous world.
        #ASS_IoSrfSplashedevaReportLavaLake = Maybe God will give me the ability to be immortal?
        #ASS_IoSrfLandedevaReportLavaLake = You looked at the volcano not far away and felt a sense of fear.

        #ASS_GanymedeInSpaceLowcrawReport = The ship appears to be picking up radio signals from the world below. You start trying to find where the source of the signal is.
        #ASS_GanymedeInSpacecrewReport =    A massive moon, larger than Mercury. At the same time, the instruments on the spacecraft also detected the existence of a weak magnetic field.
        #ASS_GanymedeFlyingcrewReport =     Through the porthole, you see the outside world. It seems full of life. You observe the world below, trying to find some traces of life. \nThe composition of the atmosphere also confirms this. On this satellite, no matter what, there is at least life, even if it is only a mononuclear cell life form.
        #ASS_GanymedeSrfSplashedcrewReport = We splashed down on Ganymede's sea, and you felt the huge waves rocking the ship. You couldn't hold it back and vomited in the spaceship.

        #ASS_GannedeFlyingLowevaReportYunJikeng = If you didn't look carefully, it would be almost impossible to tell that this is a crater because it is so big and the walls are so flat.

        #ASS_CallistoInSpaceLowcrawReport = Research shows that Callisto has a large amount of liquid water covering its surface and only a small amount of land on its surface. And Callisto appears to be very old. Its surface retains the landforms of its early birth, but is now submerged in water.
        #ASS_CallistoInSpacecrewReport =    Research shows that the water content of this planet's moons may be the highest among all planetary satellite systems in the solar system. Among the four Galilean satellites, only Io does not contain water, and the other three contain large amounts of water. Under such circumstances, the satellite outside the window is no longer enough to attract you.
        #ASS_CallistoFlyingcrewReport =     You observe a cloud floating in the sky that resembles a UFO.
        #ASS_CallistoSrfSplashedcrewReport = The water temperature here seems to be very close to our home, the ocean is so warm. The only difference is that the sea is not so calm. \nSuddenly, you are attracted by the sound of lightning and thunder outside the cabin. You look in the direction of the sound and you see a dark cloud.
        #ASS_CallistoSrfLandedcrewReport =  The ice outside appears to be slowly melting, with small amounts of water flowing lower.
        #ASS_CallistoInSpaceLowevaReport =  You searched carefully. After searching for a while, you found a small piece of land. Fortunately, at least this is not a world completely soaked in water.

        #ASS_CallistoFlyingevaReport =      It’s time for me to get back on my ship
        #ASS_CallistoFlyingLowevaReport =   The situation is a little dangerous
        #ASS_CallistoSrfSplashedevaReport = You are soaking in the warm water, staring at the thick cloud layer not far in front of you, which is a cloud layer that is constantly lightning. Maybe it's time for us to get out of here.
        #ASS_CallistoSrfLandedevaReport =   You step on the land of Callisto, and you feel a trickle of water slowly washing over your boots. You look down and find a small amount of liquid water flowing on the surface, and you start trying to find it. Where is the water source but you didn't succeed. Maybe it just stopped raining here?
        #ASS_CallistoFlyingLowevaReportisland = The world below looks strangely deserted
        #ASS_CallistoInSpaceLowevaReportisland = You heard the faint sound of running water

        #ASS_SaturnInSpacecrewReport =      You have seen the huge and bright E and G rings of Saturn. How beautiful it is. Even if the main ring is gone, it still does not affect it as the most beautiful planet in the solar system.
        #ASS_SaturnFlyingcrewReport =       The gas planet below is so huge that you'd mistake Saturn for being flat. \nSuddenly you report to the space center that you have discovered a huge island, but are criticized by the command center.
        #ASS_SaturnSrfSplashedcrewReport =  The spacecraft splashed onto Saturn's ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen and it's hard to believe how we survived and are we really alive? You sit silently in the cabin and thank God.
        #ASS_SaturnSrfLandedcrewReport =    You marvel in disbelief at how huge these islands are. At the same time, I felt very incredible.
        #ASS_SaturnInSpaceLowevaReport =    The orange world below looks very peaceful, and you have been looking for a long time but you haven't found a big storm. So your telescope turns to the rings of Saturn, and suddenly, you spot several celestial objects shaped like goose eggs.
        #ASS_SaturnInSpaceevaReport =       You see a huge light blue halo, how beautiful it is, reflecting beautiful colors under the sun. You can't help but try to reach out and touch it.
        #ASS_SaturnFlyingLowevaReport =     Through the thick clouds, you see the ocean below, a sea of liquid metallic hydrogen that reaches thousands of degrees. \nSuddenly, you see several huge floating islands in the sky over Saturn not far away. You are thinking, how do they float?
        #ASS_SaturnFlyingevaReport =        Looking at the rolling sea of liquid metal hydrogen under your feet, you are very scared, because you know what the consequences will be if you fall.
        #ASS_SaturnevaSrfLanded =           You are standing on an unknown island in shock, thinking to yourself, the existence here is really incredible, are we really still alive? Or is everything before us an illusion and we are already dead?

        #ASS_MinasInSpace =                 You discovered that there is a huge crater on the surface of Mimas, maybe it suffered a huge impact. \n You are marveling at how huge this crater is. Even though you are still relatively far away from Mimas at the moment, this crater is still so huge and obvious.
        #ASS_MinasSrfLandedcrewReport =     The ground of the world outside the porthole is scattered with many sharp and tiny gravels. Although they do not pose a threat to our spacecraft, they will bring great safety hazards to subsequent outdoor activities.
        #ASS_MimasInSpaceLowevaReport =     It looks very uneven, which may mean that if you need to land, landing in the huge crater may be the best option.
        #ASS_MimasInSpaceevaReport =        Its shape looks distinctly flat. Its surface has a huge crater, many cracks, and numerous peaks.
        #ASS_MimasSrfLandedevaReport =      Be careful with every step you take, because once you fall on the sharp ice, your spacesuit is likely to be damaged, causing oxygen leakage.

        #ASS_SaturnIIInSpaceLowcreawReport = You observe that there are many cracks on the surface of Enceladus. They are very deep, as if they lead straight to hell. Every time the spacecraft flies over these cracks, you are very scared and nervous, because you know that once Enceladus starts to erupt, you will definitely die above the cracks.
        #ASS_SaturnIIInSpace =              You find that this space snowball is erupting volcanically, but the eruption is water. The violent volcanic eruption will eject a large amount of water and ice mixture from the cracks. This ice-water mixture escapes Enceladus at very high speeds and enters the orbit of Saturn, constantly replenishing the material in Saturn's outer rings. We might have to be careful if we go near it. Be careful not to get hit by the erupted material.
        #ASS_SaturnIISrfLandedcrewReport =  Through the portholes, you can see the cold world and the stars in the sky. and Saturn's outer rings, which glow pale blue in the darkness.
        #ASS_SaturnIIInSpaceLowevaReport =  You look at the cracks below and realize that they are so deep that even the sun cannot shine into the depths of the cracks. Suddenly you notice a large amount of water-ice mixture erupting from a distant crack, and you notice that these eruptions are escaping Enceladus at very high speeds. The height of the eruption is much higher than the orbital height of our spacecraft, and you start to worry about whether the cracks below will suddenly erupt.
        #ASS_SaturnIIInSpaceevaReport =     From this distance, the satellite appears to be smooth and has few surface blemishes.
        #ASS_SaturnIISrfLandedevaReport =   You are standing on the ice of Enceladus, looking at the geyser-like mixture of ice and water erupting in the distance. You try to carve through the thick ice to fish.
    
        #ASS_SaturnIIIInSpaceLowcreawReport = You notice that the world made of ice below has many peaks and countless craters. You also find that the white areas are unusually flat, as if they are frozen lakes.
        #ASS_SaturnIIIInSpace =             A Space Snowball~ \nYou notice that there are some whiter areas on this satellite. You are wondering why these areas are so white, and they seem to be flat in position.
        #ASS_SaturnIIISrfLandedcrewReport = A cold and lifeless world.
        #ASS_TethysSrfSplashedcrewReport =  Your spaceship hit hard under the thin ice layer, a hole was made in the fragile ice layer, and your spaceship fell into the lake of this layer of ice and water mixture. But fortunately the spacecraft did not continue to dive.
        #ASS_TethysInSpaceLowevaReport =    You also noticed that this world also has volcanic eruptions. Like Enceladus, it has volcanoes that spew out a mixture of ice and water. But fortunately, the pressure here does not seem to be high enough, and these eruptions cannot spray to very high places, which does not pose a threat.
        #ASS_TethysInSpaceevaReport =       It looks like it has so many craters that you can barely find a flat piece of land on it. Except for those weird white areas.
        #ASS_TethysevaSrfLanded =           This cold world is so rugged and rugged that all you can see is the endless mountains and ravines. Feeling a little bored, you start looking up at the stars and trying to find the other moons of Saturn.
        #ASS_TethysSrfSplashedevaReport =   You carefully step out of the spacecraft and step onto this layer of ice. Since the contact area is very small, you still fall in. At this time, you find that crawling on this layer of ice may be the best way to move. This can increase your contact area with the lake and prevent you from falling into it.

        #ASS_DioneInSpaceLowcreawReport =   Its surface is like a hornet's nest, with dense craters. This once again makes our exploration more difficult
        #ASS_DioneInSpace =                 A space snowball~ \nThrough the porthole, you find a huge mountain range on the surface of this satellite.
        #ASS_DioneSrfLandedcrewReport =     It seems unremarkable.
        #ASS_DioneInSpaceLowevaReport =     You looked at the landscape below and couldn't help but say: "A huge hornet's nest?"
        #ASS_DioneInSpaceevaReport =        it looks boring
        #ASS_DioneevaSrfLanded =            Are you looking at the white ice below and wondering what is underneath it?

        #ASS_RheaInSpaceLowcreawReport =    You observed that this satellite appears to have an atmosphere
        #ASS_RheaInSpace =                  At this distance, the satellite appears to be very bright. It reflects most of the sun's light, making it appear very bright.
        #ASS_RheaSrfLandedcrewReport =      The ice in the distance reflects most of the sunlight, which passes through the windows and shines into the spacecraft. Even if you don't need to turn on the lighting, the cabin is still very bright.
        #ASS_RheaInSpaceLowevaReport =      You notice that this moon has a thin atmosphere with a pressure no different than a vacuum.
        #ASS_RheaInSpaceevaReport =         It seems to have an Ring?
        #ASS_RheaevaSrfLanded =             You are standing on the ground of Rhea, looking up at Rhea's Ring.
        #ASS_RheaFlyingcrewReport =         Our spacecraft is flying in the atmosphere of Rhea, but we can completely ignore the existence of this atmosphere because its air pressure is too low.
        #ASS_RheaFlyingLowevaReport =       Very close to the ground, you look at the landscape below. All you can see are endless hills, but these hills reflect a large part of the sun's light, which makes you feel a little dazzling. .
        #ASS_RheaFlyingevaReport =          This thin atmosphere is almost like a vacuum
   
        #ASS_TitanInSpaceLowcrawReport =    From your spacecraft orbiting Titan, you see how beautiful this distant planet is and you see the world slowly rolling beneath your feet. From this altitude you cannot see any man-made structures , they are all too small.
        #ASS_TitanInSpacecrewReport =       At this altitude you can see the entirety of Titan. This world has a large area of land with several rivers running through it. \nThe colonization of the advance team a few years ago also further told us that the oxygen content of this world has increased to an astonishing 31.8%. Such a high oxygen content is all thanks to the transformation of this planet by humans thousands of years ago, but it is still a little cold now.
        #ASS_TitanFlyingcrewReport =        We are flying in the atmosphere of Titan. The atmosphere here seems to be 50% thicker than that of the parent star. You may need more power to fly quickly. At this height, it feels like you can reach out and touch the sky.
        #ASS_TitanSrfSplashedcrewReport =   You landed on the waters of Titan. In such a gravity environment, you observed that the height of the waves was much higher than that of our spacecraft, and they were slowly approaching us. But you don’t need to worry at all, because we have enough time to escape before this huge wave sweeps over. \nAt the same time, you find that the rivers and lakes here are very shallow, and their average depth is only about 100 meters.
        #ASS_TitanSrfLandedcrewReport =     You look out the window at the cold desert. It seems a bit desolate, with only a few trees, but these plants seem surprisingly huge, and their height seems to be nearly a hundred meters high.
        #ASS_TitanInSpaceLowevaReport =     You are floating in the orbit of Titan hundreds of kilometers high. At this altitude, you can see the wide rivers, huge lakes, and land covered with green on this moon. And the slowly moving white clouds. The only thing separating you from it at this moment is the atmosphere hundreds of kilometers high. This is the last bit of distance in nearly a billion kilometers.
        #ASS_TitanInSpaceevaReport =        You are floating in empty space, feeling endless loneliness and emptiness. At this time, "Light Years Away" is playing in your headphones. At this time, you feel that your current situation is integrated into the song, and you can't help but hum along with the song.
        #ASS_TitanFlyingevaReport =         Things are a little dangerous
        #ASS_TitanFlyingLowevaReport =      It's a dangerous situation
        #ASS_TitanSrfSplashedevaReport =    You took off your helmet and soaked in the waters of this alien world. You dived into the water and found that the water was not as turbid as you imagined. You saw that the water plants under the water were constantly changing with the flow of the water. Swinging.
        #ASS_TitanSrfLandedevaReport =      You looked up at the giant plant and a bold idea came to mind: try to climb to the top of the plant.
        #ASS_TitanSrfLandedevaReportCoolWater = The soil here contains so much water that when you step on it, you can see the water being squeezed out, making your boots dirty.
        #ASS_TitanInSpaceLowevaReportCoolWater = A wide river.
        #ASS_TitanFlyingLowevaReportCoolWater = Maybe the soft mud could cushion a lot of the impact.
        #ASS_TitanSrfLandedcrewReportCoolWater = Did you notice that the attitude of the spacecraft seems to be a little unbalanced? Did it get stuck in the mud?

        #ASS_IapetusInSpaceLowcreawReport = You noticed a strange bulge in the equatorial region of Iapetus and a huge crater in the northern hemisphere. \nIts existence makes you think, is this really not a giant spaceship?
        #ASS_IapetusInSpace =               The world seems to be made of white and brown. It seems like the two hemispheres are different colors.
        #ASS_IapetusSrfLandedcrewReport =   Through the porthole, you saw a silent alien world, but it seemed a little weird?
        #ASS_IapetusInSpaceLowevaReport =   You notice that there appears to be a moon orbiting Iapetus
        #ASS_IapetusInSpaceevaReport =      A giant alien spaceship?
        #ASS_IapetusevaSrfLanded =          You stand in this strange alien world, feeling a little uneasy in your heart.

        #ASS_ClymeneInSpaceLowcreawReport = You notice that it seems to have the same shape as Iapetus, with a clear equatorial bulge
        #ASS_ClymeneInSpace =               Strange, its existence is not recorded in the star catalog. When did it appear?
        #ASS_ClymeneSrfLandedcrewReport =   This celestial body seems to be very dim, and the dimness of the surface and the dark universe seem to merge into one.
        #ASS_ClymeneInSpaceLowevaReport =   You try your best to look into the dark universe, trying your best to adapt your eyes to the dark environment, and finally you can clearly see the landscape of this coal-black celestial body.
        #ASS_ClymeneInSpaceevaReport =      “A giant flying pancake?” This is your first impression of this undocumented celestial body.
        #ASS_ClymeneevaSrfLanded =          At this moment, there seems to be no boundary between heaven and surface

        #ASS_UranusInSpaceLowcrawReport =   You notice a huge white cloud at the north pole of Uranus that looks like a giant ice cap. \nAt the same time, you find that the world seems very dead, and there are almost no cyclones in the clouds below.
        #ASS_UranusInSpacecrewReport =      The long space voyage makes you full of exhaustion and stress. The moment you see Uranus, all the tension and fatigue disappear instantly. You can't remember how long it has been since you left home and sailed in this dark universe.
        #ASS_UranusFlyingcrewReport =       Gravity presses you firmly on the seat, but after a while, you get used to the gravity here, and you find that the gravity here is not very high.
        #ASS_UranusSrfSplashedcrewReport =  You look at the liquid outside the window and feel that it is very strange. It is obviously water, but it doesn't look like it, and the density is very high. Even a spaceship as heavy as yours can still float on it.
        #ASS_UranusSrfLandedcrewReport =    Is this all an illusion? We traveled through the thick atmosphere of an ice giant to reach its icy shell? \nYou pinched your face and realized that all this was not an illusion.
        #ASS_UranusInSpaceLowevaReport =    Looking at Uranus below, you look very excited, as if all the fatigue caused by space travel has disappeared at this moment.
        #ASS_UranusInSpaceevaReport =       A beautiful gaseous planet that reflects a beautiful blue-white color when illuminated by the sun. \nYou also notice that Uranus also has a ring, but it seems a little dim.
        #ASS_UranusFlyingLowevaReport =     The situation is dangerous.
        #ASS_UranusFlyLowevaReport =        I think it’s time for me to get back in the spaceship, otherwise I’ll never come home again
        #ASS_UranusevaSrfLanded =           You are in the icy shell beneath Uranus' thick atmosphere, and you feel the pressure as if it is crushing you. At this moment, the only thing that isolates you from the outside world is the space suit, which is less than 1 cm thick.
        #ASS_UranusSrfSplashedevaReport =   The liquid down there feels really weird because it feels like water but not water.
        #ASS_UranusFlyingcrewReportEye =    There seems to be a huge black hole in this blue cloud.
        #ASS_UranusFlyingcrewReportSPB =    The surrounding clouds are very bright.
        #ASS_UranusInSpaceLowevaReportSPB = It seems like a huge ice cap.
        #ASS_UranusInSpaceLowevaReport = Quick, quick, look, there is a big eye on Uranus.
        #ASS_UranusFlyLowevaReportEye = It seems that I am not falling into Uranus, but a black hole.
        #ASS_UranusInSpaceLowevaReportSPB = You feel something big and small hitting you on the head, and you notice that it is raining, but it is raining diamonds.

        #ASS_MirandaInSpaceLowcreawReport = You notice that it has a very high cliff on the surface, which is a great place for skydiving.
        #ASS_MirandaInSpace =               Look, Miranda!
        #ASS_MirdandaSrfLandedcrewReport =  You tried to experience skydiving with a parachute in Verona Rupes. \nBut the moment you open the hatch, you realize that this frozen world has no atmosphere.
        #ASS_MirandaInSpaceLowevaReport =   In such a low gravity environment, maybe it's safe
        #ASS_MirandaInSpaceevaReport =      You look at Verona Rupes and realize it is so high that you visually estimate it to be at least 20 kilometers high.
        #ASS_MirandaevaSrfLanded =          The gravity here is so low that you can reach tens of meters high with just a slight jump. If this world had an atmosphere, skydiving would feel amazing here.

        #ASS_ArielInSpaceLowcreawReport =   Suddenly a bold idea came to mind: You might be able to land and return to this celestial body with your jetpack.
        #ASS_ArielInSpace =                 You notice that this gray moon looks anything but smooth from a distance. It is full of canyons and has a lot of craters.
        #ASS_ArielSrfLandedcrewReport =     The spacecraft landed on the slippery ground, slid for a distance and stopped safely.
        #ASS_ArielInSpaceLowevaReport =     Maybe you could land directly with a jetpack? But no one has ever succeeded.
        #ASS_ArielInSpaceevaReport =        Will it spew a mixture of ice and water from cracks like Enceladus?
        #ASS_ArielevaSrfLanded =            You are looking up at the stars, trying to find the location of your home planet.

        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceLowcreawReport = It looks very boring, you can barely find any features in the gray landscape.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpace =               Umbriel disappeared? As your eyes gradually adjust to the surrounding light, you finally observe the celestial body against the background of the universe. \nAt this time you notice that it has two craters filled with white. They are like a pair of eyes, staring straight at you.
        #ASS_UmbrielSrfLandedcrewReport =   Its surface seems to be covered with a thick layer of ash. When the spacecraft landed, the engine reverse stack blew away some of the ash. Now they are falling slowly. Some ash fell on the spacecraft, making the spacecraft look like Much dirtier.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceLowevaReport =   You try to squint and stare down, but you find that you can barely see a little bit of the landscape below.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceevaReport =      It looks so dark that you can barely see the features on this celestial body.
        #ASS_UmbrielevaSrfLanded =          Your boots left a distinct footprint on this celestial body.

        #ASS_Titania114514 =                Your eye is drawn to the strange white landforms, but you are not sure how they were formed
        #ASS_Titania114514 =                You notice that the north and south polar regions of this moon appear to be whiter and brighter than the regions near the equator.
        #ASS_Titania114514 =                Uranus overhead is like a huge moon, glowing blue under the sunlight.
        #ASS_TitaniaFlyingLowevaReport =    An icy red desert
        #ASS_TitaniaFlyLowevaReport =       You notice that the distant hillsides seem to be covered with some white substance, making them appear whiter than the base of the mountains.
        #ASS_TitaniaInSpaceLowcreawReport = It seems that the world below reflects a scary reddish-brown color under the sunlight.
        #ASS_TitaniaInSpace =               You noticed that there are several large white spots on this celestial body, but you are not sure whether they are caused by geological movement.
        #ASS_TItaniaSrfLandedcrewReport =   It’s not until the spacecraft lands that you discover that this world has an atmosphere so thin that you mistake it for the onboard computer’s misjudgment.
        #ASS_TitaniaFlyingcrewReport =      The world below is red in contrast to its temperature.

        #ASS_OberonInSpaceLowcreawReport =  You observe several large craters below, which may indicate that the satellite has suffered a huge impact.
        #ASS_OberonInSpace =                You notice that the northern region of this icy moon seems to be brighter than the rest of the planet, making it look like a large ice cap.

        #ASS_OberonevaSrfLanded =           You set foot on this icy desert, and with every step you take, you leave a distinct footprint on this land.

        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowevaReport =   You notice that there is a lot of space debris orbiting Neptune at very fast speeds.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceevaReport =      You are floating in empty space looking at the giant ice giant below, and you discover a huge cyclone in the clouds of Neptune.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingLowevaReport =    My vision is blocked by fog, the situation is very dangerous!
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyLowevaReport =       The situation is dangerous!
        #ASS_NeptuneevaSrfLanded =          You are standing on Neptune's icy shell, feeling the strong winds blowing by several times the speed of sound.

        #ASS_NeptuneSrfSplashedcrewReport = You look at the liquid outside the window and feel that it is very strange. It is obviously water, but it doesn't look like it, and the density is very high. Even a spaceship as heavy as yours can still float on it.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfLandedcrewReport =   You've landed on Neptune's icy crust, but you still feel like your entire spacecraft is shaking.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowevaReporImpontiStormEyet = The huge cyclone below seems to be sucking us into it.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyLowevaReportImpontiStormEye = You feel the wind speed around you getting faster and faster.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingLowevaReportImpontiStormEye = You notice strong lightning near the storm.

        #ASS_NeptuneSrfLandedcrewReportImpontiStormEye = Through the porthole, you saw the huge storm above. It was rotating at high speed, accompanied by strong lightning.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceevaReportWC =        You notice a white cloud floating in Neptune's atmosphere below. What is the composition of this cloud?
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyLowevaReportWC =         Their composition appears to be water vapor.    
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingcrewReportWC =        Look, the white clouds outside the window! Why does it appear on gas planets?
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowevaReportPB =     Look, Triton!

        #ASS_LarissaInSpaceLowcrawReport =  You notice that the rocks below are getting softer and flowing downwards
        #ASS_LarissaInSpacecrewReport =     You noticed that this moon is almost at the edge of Neptune's Roche limit, where strong tidal forces soften the rock and glow red.
        #ASS_LarissaFlyingcrewReport =      Through the porthole, you see how huge Neptune is outside the window. The hurricane in Neptune's atmosphere is like an eye staring at this huge rock.
        #ASS_LarissaSrfSplashedcrewReport = Unexpectedly, there is a rare source of heat in the cold world.
        #ASS_LarissaInSpaceLowevaReport =   This might be a place for adventure.

        #ASS_LarissaswimLavaeva =           The temperature of the lava here doesn't seem to be very high, and the suit may be able to hold up for a while.

        #ASS_TritonInSpaceLowcrawReport =   Maybe we can figure out a way to use the methane in the lake below to refuel the spacecraft?
        #ASS_TritonInSpacecrewReport =      You observe that Triton has a large methane lake in its southern hemisphere.
        #ASS_TritonFlyingcrewReport =       The atmosphere here is thinner, but can still create significant drag on the spacecraft. Then you see a thin cloud, and you wonder if methane will rain in this icy world.
        #ASS_TritonSrfSplashedcrewReport =  Methane is much less dense than water, so we have to be careful not to sink the spacecraft.
        #ASS_TritonSrfLandedcrewReport =    You noticed that there is an orange mist filling the lower ground outside, and it is slowly drifting towards us.
        #ASS_TritonInSpaceLowevaReport =    Looking at the rivers and lakes below and the methane in the lakes reminds you of the Yellow River in ancient China.
        #ASS_TritonInSpaceevaReport =       You are trying to find some special landform features
        #ASS_TritonFlyingLowevaReport =     The situation seems dangerous
        #ASS_TritonFlyLowevaReport =        You observe a few thin clouds floating in the sky, but they disperse quickly.
        #ASS_TritonevaSrfLanded =           The world in front of you looks like yellow sand flying all over the sky, which creates a hot atmosphere, but the actual temperature is completely opposite to this scene.
        #ASS_TritonSrfSplashedevaReport =   Swimming in the extremely low-density and very cold methane, which provides little buoyancy, is very difficult.

        #ASS_PlutoFlyingcrewReport =        You look at the frozen world below and notice a few strange tracks, like the tracks of a car driving through the sand.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfLandedcrewReport =     Through the glass, you see the giant companion star Charon hanging in the sky. At this time you can't wait to get out because you don't know how long you have been on the spacecraft.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowevaReport =     Pluto looks cute
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceevaReport =        From this angle, the sun's light has become much softer, and there is no longer that dazzling feeling.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingLowevaReport =      You admire the beauty of the universe
        #ASS_PlutoFlyLowevaReport =         At this moment, you appreciate the vastness of the universe and the greatness of life.
        #ASS_PlutoevaSrfLanded =            You look up at the starry sky and find that the starry sky is very bright. You turn your head to look at the sun and find that there is a group of nebulae emitting dark red light around the sun, and they are slowly spreading outward.
        #ASS_PlutoevaSrfLandedTombaughRegio = You noticed that the terrain in this area is relatively flat.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowevaReportTombaughRegio = A huge heart.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingLowevaReportTombaughRegio = Suddenly, you notice that there seems to be a red statue with a human face on the ground.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingevaReportTombaughRegio =     You stare at the heart-shaped plain below, trying to discover something.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingcrewReportTombaughRegio =    Through the hanging window, you looked at the endless white tundra outside the window.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfLandedcrewReportTombaughRegio = You noticed that the tundra outside the window is constantly emitting gas, which may be nitrogen.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyLowevaReportSolitudeisland =    You seem to have found a strange structure in the southern part of the hills. It looks like a red mound.
        #ASS_PlutoevaSrfLandedSolitudeisland =       You noticed that there are many mountains here, but they are lower in altitude and darker in color.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowevaReportSolitudeisland = From here, you see a lot of mountains below.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingcrewReportSolitudeisland =      The hills below look very dark and a bit reddish. Could it be methane?
        #ASS_PlutoSrfLandedcrewReportSolitudeisland = Through the porthole, you see endless gray hills outside the window, but they don't seem to be high.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingcrewReportBaiJiLake = Suddenly, you are horrified to find a car next to the crater below!
