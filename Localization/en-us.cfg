        #ASS_Muna_name = Muna
		#ASS_Muna_desc = Muna/Jishen is an ancient super-Earth that was larger than the Earth in the solar system. But this super-Earth does not come from our solar system, but from a red dwarf star system. All this comes from 10.9 billion years ago...\n12.4 billion years ago, a small piece of dust in a corner of the Milky Way was being compressed. The dust was compressed inward in a spiral form, forming a dense celestial body that glowed and heated... and finally a star was born. This is a red dwarf star with spectrum M4V. In the subsequent time, the dust disk orbiting the star began to condense to form planets. At a location slightly farther from the star, three gaseous planets were being formed, with their orbits in a ratio of 1:2:4. Among them, the more inner objects formed rapidly. The two of them almost emptied all the material in the dust disk, forming huge gaseous planets. The celestial body outside the star system did not absorb enough material to form a gas planet, but evolved into a mini ice giant with a radius of about 8000km...\nAt this time, rocky objects in this star system were forming, and the two giant gaseous planets began to rapidly migrate outward, causing the fragile resonance orbit between them to break. The mini ice giant began to receive the gravitational pull of the outermost gaseous planet and was thrown into the star system. At this time, the parent star was young and powerful, and the strong solar wind blew away the atmosphere of the mini ice giant, which caused it to Became a super earth. When this super-Earth entered the star system, its huge gravity also disturbed the star system and captured a rocky planet that was forming. The rocky planet was close in size to Mercury... Since there is no planet in the star system Something can make this super Earth stop, so this super Earth moves in a highly eccentric orbit, causing its semi-major axis to jump in the gravitational slingshot of two gaseous planets... Finally, 12.2 billion years ago, The super-Earth was ejected into interstellar space, carrying a huge planetary fragment in the Milky Way for nearly 10 billion years...\n In 2.4 billion years, this super-Earth moved near the solar system. Due to its low relative speed, it entered the hyperbolic orbit of the sun. It crossed the Kuiper Belt and entered the solar system at a position close to the ecliptic. The huge gravity caused it to be hit by a large number of asteroids... Until now, you can see the traces left on Muna and its moon Moll. After passing through the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt, this super-Earth entered the inner solar system, passing Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn... Under the gravity of Jupiter, it entered the elliptical orbit of the sun from the hyperbolic orbit of the sun, and interacted with the sun. Jupiter formed a resonance orbit. Over the course of tens of thousands of years, it flew past Saturn and Jupiter many times, gradually lowering its aphelion and entering the asteroid belt at its perihelion. After a certain flyby of Jupiter, the super-Earth happened to enter the orbit of Hygiea. Due to the huge gravity and extremely high relative speed, Hygiea collided with this super Earth. This long impact caused Muna's speed to drop sharply, causing it to completely enter the asteroid belt and no longer intersect with any planets. The satellite captured by this super Earth maintained its original speed because its momentum did not change. However, it did not break away from the gravity of the super Earth, but entered a higher eccentricity orbit around it...

    	#ASS_Moll_name = Moll
		#ASS_Moll_desc = This is an ancient celestial body. Like Jishen, it does not belong to the solar system. \nThe object was formed inside a red dwarf star system about 10 billion years ago. Since it was formed inside a red dwarf star system, its core has a high iron content, thus forming a larger iron core. Therefore, the density is Achieved 4.81 grams per cubic centimeter. It has reached hydrostatic equilibrium. It should have been able to continue accreting debris in the dust disk of its parent star and continue to grow. However, due to the three gaseous planets outside the star system disrupting each other's orbits, the smaller ice giant was ejected. Entering the interior of the star system, the ice giant's strong gravitational pull captured the celestial body and kept it in its own orbit. Later, the thin atmosphere of the ice giant in a large elliptical orbit was blown away, and at a later date it was ejected by the gravity of two giant gaseous planets. At the same time as it was ejected, this huge piece of debris also left the original red dwarf star system along with the planet. and roamed the Milky Way for nearly ten billion years. Then it followed the planet into the orbit of the sun... Eventually, it was discovered by humans outside the solar system using the transit method, and was named "Moll", and the parent star was named "Muna/Jishen". Through the gravitational perturbation of Muna by Moll, it is found that the mass of Moll is 1/28.67 of Muna. Such a huge mass puts the system's center of mass at a distance of 6,929 kilometers from Muna's center of mass. For a celestial body with a radius of 7100km, it is almost on the surface. Even if it has such a large mass, according to human definition, it is still not a "double planet" but a satellite. Due to its strong tidal force, it and Muna are tidally locked with each other, with only one side always facing each other. But later, a scientific expedition team returned to the solar system and tried to accelerate Muna and the rotation of Muna's core to restore its magnetic field, but ultimately failed. This makes Muna's rotation period no longer as long as 10 days. At the same time, Moll also produced strong tidal forces and strong winds on Muna. Tidal forces can cause Muna's ocean to flood some low-lying areas.  This requires the colonial station to be at a high altitude, otherwise the sea water will flood。   \nOn the night of Jishen, you can see a huge gray disk hanging in the sky, but this disk is much larger than when you stood on the earth and looked at the moon 7.8 billion years ago. Although the reflectivity of Moll is very low, only 0.12. But due to its close proximity and large size, it is still very bright. Despite its size, it still cannot completely block the sun from forming a total solar eclipse. If you have the chance, you'll only see a partial eclipse.   \n Moll's structure is similar to that of Mercury, with a crust, mantle, and core. Moll's core is as massive as the Moon and has a radius of approximately 1,321 kilometers. This makes it the third densest object in the solar system .

At the same time, you can also find it quickly passing through the sky where you are. This is because the satellite's orbital period is very fast, and it only takes 10 hours to orbit Muna. Currently affected by strong tidal forces, its orbit is still migrating inward, eventually entering Muna's Roche limit and being torn into pieces. By then, we will be able to see that Muna has a beautiful halo.

        #ASS_Jupiter_desc = This ancient planet is the largest planet in the star system, with a mass 2.5 times that of all the planets in the star system combined. \n This is the planet in our solar system - Jupiter\n Jupiter is the fifth closest planet to the sun and the largest planet in the solar system. Astronomers discovered this planet very early. The Romans called it after their god. The planet is Jupiter. In ancient China, Jupiter was called the Sui Star. It took about 12 years to orbit the celestial sphere, which was the same as the earthly branches, and the Sui Star chronology was born. It is said that the ancients observed that the year star was cyan, and cyan belongs to wood in the "Five Elements", so they named it Jupiter. This planet is also the only way for humans to fly out of the solar system. Many detectors leaving the solar system have used the gravity of this planet to reach the speed of escaping from the sun, thus leaving the solar system. These include the New Horizons probe, Voyager 1, and 2 probes. \n In the past, Jupiter had a conspicuous feature, that is, the Great Red Spot - a persistent anticyclonic storm larger than the Earth, located 22° south of the equator, and its existence was known as early as 1665. This storm can be seen using a 12 cm or larger telescope. But the big red spot disappeared soon after. \nDue to its massive gravity well and proximity to the inner solar system, Jupiter is known as the solar system's vacuum cleaner. It is the planet most frequently hit by comets in the solar system. It is thought to be a protective umbrella that protects the planets in the inner solar system from comets. \n It has four larger satellites, called "Galileo" satellites. Among them, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto may have liquid oceans under their surfaces, so they are of great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Humanity has also sent multiple probes to these satellites, and the data sent back by the probes also confirms this. This is a precious fresh water resource. \n Today, the sun is about to die. Under the light of the early red giant star, the water that once existed in solid form begins to melt, forming rivers, rivers, lakes, and seas composed of liquid water. At the same time, an atmosphere is formed. These satellites are protected by Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The atmosphere can be protected from being stripped away by the solar wind... \n Maybe we can try to move our homes here?

		#ASS_Saturn_name = Saturn
		#ASS_Saturn_desc = Saturn is one of the eight planets in the solar system, and its size is second only to Jupiter. And it is a gas (Jupiter-like) giant planet like Jupiter. In ancient China, it was also called star-holding and star-filling. It is said that the ancients observed that the Zhenxing was yellow, and yellow belongs to the earth in the "Five Elements", so they named it Saturn.\nSaturn is famous for its beautiful rings. It was also the first planet to be discovered with rings. In July 1610, Galileo Galilei observed the rings of Saturn with his homemade telescope, but because of the poor imaging of the telescope, he did not realize that it was a ring. He wrote in a letter to the Grand Duke of Tuscany: "Saturn is not a single individual. It is composed of three parts. These parts are almost all in contact with each other and have no relative motion with each other. Their connection is parallel to the ecliptic, and the central part (Saturn's body) is about three times larger than the sides (rims of the rings)". He also described Saturn as having "ears." In 1612, the rings of Saturn were turned sideways toward the Earth and seemed to have disappeared. Galileo Galilei was confused and asked, "Did Saturn swallow up its children?" To prevent their descendants from rebelling and seizing power, they will eat their own children). Then, in 1613, he saw the ring again, which confused Galileo even more. In 1655, Christian Huygens observed the complete rings of Saturn, using a much more powerful telescope than was available in Galileo's time. Huygens observed Saturn and wrote: "It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat ring, which is not in contact with the planet and is tilted with respect to the ecliptic." In 1675, Giovanni Cassini determined the rings of Saturn It is composed of many smaller rings with gaps in the middle. The most obvious ring gap was soon named Cassini's gap. The Cassini gap exists between the A and B rings and is 4,800 kilometers wide.In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that Saturn's rings could not be solid, otherwise they would become unstable and break apart. He believed that the rings were composed of numerous small particles, each of which orbited Saturn independently. Through spectroscopic studies, James Keeler of Lick Observatory confirmed Maxwell's theory in 1895.\n One theory proposed in the 19th century originated from the Roche limit. It is believed that the ring was originally a satellite of Saturn. Due to the attenuation of the orbit, it fell into the range of the Roche limit. It was not tight enough and was torn apart by tidal forces. away (see Roche limit); this theory evolved into the theory that the satellite was disintegrated by the impact of an asteroid or comet, and the change that extended from this theory was that the satellite was disintegrated by the collision of a large comet or asteroid, thus Such a huge halo was formed. \n Under the influence of Saturn's magnetic field, material on the rings fell to Saturn in the form of a ring rain over hundreds of millions of years, and eventually the ring disappeared. Although Saturn still has a ring today, it is much dimmer than the ring that existed billions of years ago.\n Today, the sun has entered the red giant stage. Under the initial lighting conditions of the red giant, Saturn has initially entered the habitable zone. The higher temperature causes Saturn to gradually lose its original orange-green appearance and turn into white. At this moment, its moons will begin to come to life amid the death of the Sun
